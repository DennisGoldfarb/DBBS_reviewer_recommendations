"Abu-Amer, Yousef"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology			"Our research interests are focused on understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory osteolysis. Human diseases such as erosive arthritis and aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants are complicated with inflammatory responses owing to infiltration of host defense cells including macrophages and osteoclasts culminating with elevated osteolysis. Thus, remedies to combat deterioration of bone directly should target the cells solely responsible for osteolysis, i.e. osteoclasts. We have several translational projects with immediate relevance to human osteolytic diseases. Specifically, we are investigating 1) mechanisms of particle induction of osteoclasts and osteolysis in response to orthopedic particles normally used in implants. 2) Molecular regulation of bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) molecular regulation of inflammatory osteoclastogenesis. We have determined that NF-kB and MAP kinases are the primary mechanisms underlying these inflammatory osteolytic diseases. Further, we have identified precise elements in the NF-kB pathway capable of regulating these osteolytic pathway and hold promise for therapeutic intervention."
"Abumrad, Nada"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology			"Our research identified the membrane protein CD36 as a high affinity receptor for long chain fatty acid (FA) and as a signaling protein that plays a key role in metabolic regulation. We recently documented that CD36-mediated signal transduction involves modulation of the assembly/disassembly of proteins in the AMPK and insulin signaling pathways and we are exploring how this affects activity of downstream proteins of FA and glucose metabolism. In humans, we found that variants in the CD36 gene influence blood lipids and risk of metabolic syndrome and more recently endothelial function. We will be exploring the contribution of CD36 polymorphisms to the susceptibility for endothelial dysfunction, a condition that often precedes insulin resistance, inflammation and onset of metabolic pathologies."

These receptors are mostly located in the postsynaptic cell membrane where they respond to presynaptically released transmitter molecules with a conformational change which results in the flow of ions through the cell membrane. We have been studying the mechanisms by which agonists and antagonists interact with the ligand-gated ion channels, and how these events lead to conformational changes. We are also interested in drug interactions, i.e., how the receptors behave in the presence of clinically used anesthetics and anxiolytics.Most of the work is carried out on recombinant receptors transiently or stably expressed in a heterologous expression system, such as human embryonic kidney cells or Xenopus oocytes. We utilize an array of electrophysiological approaches: cell-attached and excised single-channel patch clamp, whole-cell and outside-out macroscopic recordings, and two-electrode voltage clamp.

Taking a translational approach to disease mechanism, I employ human airway specimens, mouse models, stem cell culture, molecular and structural biology. My postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Holtzman has to date involved the phenotypic and functional characterization of disease-associated IL-33 expressing airway cells and their pathogenic role in driving chronic airway disease. As I transition to independence, my research on this cytokine system will focus on the pathway of cellular IL-33 activation/release, including biochemical and structural definition of intracellular (nuclear, transcriptional regulatory) and extracellular aspects of this unique dual-functioning cytokine. Results of this analysis will guide efforts toward development of IL-33 antagonists as therapeutics for chronic airway disease.
My clinical interests include lung transplantation, particularly management of factors contributing to development of chronic allograft rejection, and critical care medicine.

"Amarasinghe, Gaya"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Immunology	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"The innate immune system serves as a first line of defense against viral infections. Germline encoded pattern recognition receptors detect pathogens and promote innate immune responses, including activation of type I interferons (IFNs) and stimulation of antiviral genes. In addition to limiting infections, innate immunity is required to activate humoral responses and to develop long-term protection via adaptive immune response. Dysregulation of IFN signaling is detrimental to the host, resulting in events such as cytokine storms during infections or autoimmune disorders.
In my laboratory, we use a multidisciplinary research program that spans length and time scales to address this question by characterizing the molecular mechanisms of initial interactions at the host-pathogen interface. Using this information, we expect to develop a framework to manipulate viruses by modulating virulence (less virulent) in order to gain insight into immune mechanisms that are at play during these critical time points. Our current efforts are aimed toward defining the molecular basis for viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) at the host-viral interface. VHF is a complex multivariable challenge with contributions from the virus and from the host dictating the outcome. We have begun a series of studies to understand the viral components, host factors and their interactions between each other. Below I briefly describe recent and recently completed studies that provide the experimental framework for us to examine these questions.

"Bark, David"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology		"My research is divided into three areas:
ThromboinflammationIt is increasingly recognized that platelets can stimulate an inflammatory response. We are investigating thromboinflammatory responses to various stimuli and how they can lead to complications in blood circulation. We are further quantifying biomechanical characteristics of these processes with an aim of identifying therapeutic targets that leverage mechanics.
Understanding the role of mechanics in heart developmentThe heart is the first organ that forms during embryogenesis. Pumping blood as an initial valveless 'straight' tube, it undergoes a series of changes as chambers become more defined and as valves form. To study embryonic heart development, we utilize zebrafish as a model, which exhibits similar heart development to humans during early stages. Our group is interested in identifying the role of mechanics in driving specific stages of heart development, relating functional, biomechanical, mechanobiological roles. Currently, we are investigating the mechanical properties of the embryonic heart and how they change as the heart transitions from a straight valveless tube to a multichambered adult heart. We are interested in understanding the role of mechanics in the formation of human congenital heart defects. For this effort, we are working with cardiologists at Children's Hospital Colorado to collect ultrasound data. This data is processed, allowing us to perform computational simulations of flow through the fetal heart. Through this approach we can identify specific flow patterns in congenital heart defects, which may lead to a better understanding of cardiac function for specific cases, while also allowing us to identify if specific patterns actually drive the formation of a defect.
Developing blood-contacting medical devicesMechanical heart valves are commonly used to replace failing heart valves, but often suffer thromboembolic complications, particularly associated with the hinge region of these valves. As such, there use has been declining. Therefore, we are investigating the thrombotic and coagulant responses of blood in this region to better identify the specific features of the hinge that can otherwise lead to complications once implanted.

Dr. BatemanÕs research focuses on the pathophysiology and development of improved diagnostics and treatments of AlzheimerÕs disease. Dr. Bateman treats patients with dementia at the Memory Diagnostic Center of Washington University. Dr. Bateman launched the DIAN-TU Pharma Consortium in 2011 with ten major pharmaceutical companies joining to support and assist in the development of trials for autosomal dominant AlzheimerÕs disease. Dr. Bateman directs the DIAN-TU, which launched prevention trials in families with dominantly inherited AlzheimerÕs disease in 2012. The DIAN-TU trial is an advanced worldwide adaptive trial platform that tests therapeutics targeting the pathophysiology of AlzheimerÕs disease with the goal to slow, stop or reverse AlzheimerÕs disease. The DIAN-TU has launched three Phase 2/3 drug arms with a range of amyloid-beta targets and has now launched tau-directed drugs in combination with amyloid drugs and a primary prevention trial to prevent amyloid plaques from forming.Dr. BatemanÕs lab accomplishments include pioneering the central nervous system Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK) measurements in humans, which utilizes sub-atomic labeling with stable isotopes to track in vivo protein production and clearance, leading to understanding of the time and kinetic basis of proteins leading to neurodegeneration.

"Batista, Luis"	Cancer Biology	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology		"A unique characteristic of tissue stem cells is the ability to self-renew, a process that enables the life-long maintenance of many organs. Stem cell self-renewal is dependent on the synthesis of telomere repeats by the enzyme telomerase. Defects in telomerase and in telomere maintenance genes result in diverse disease states, including dyskeratosis congenita, pulmonary fibrosis, aplastic anemia, liver cirrhosis and cancer. Many of these disease states share a tissue failure phenotype, such as loss of bone-marrow cells or failure of pulmonary epithelium, suggesting that stem cell dysfunction is a common pathophysiological mechanism underlying these telomere diseases. My lab is interested in deciphering the molecular mechanisms behind telomere-induced stem cell disease and for that we are using a variety of methods, from classic biochemistry to recently developed gene targeting techniques, to understand and restore telomere homeostasis in human stem cells with deficient telomerase. Our goal is to provide the molecular knowledge necessary for new treatment options for these syndromes.

"Baxter, Ivan"	Computational and Systems Biology	Plant and Microbial Biosciences			"Understanding how plants regulate element composition of tissues is critical for agriculture, the environment, and human health. Sustainably meeting the increasing food and biofuel demands of the planet will require growing crops with fewer inputs such as the primary macronutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). P in fertilizer is non-renewable, too expensive for subsistence farmers, and inefficiently utilized by crops, leading to runoff and severe downstream ecological consequences. Plants comprise the major portion of the human diet, and improving their elemental nutrient content can greatly affect human health. However, efforts directed at a single element can have unforeseen deleterious effects. For example, limiting iron (Fe) or P can lead to increased accumulation of the toxic elements cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As).Ê
The Baxter lab is interested in understanding how plants regulate the mobilization, uptake, translocation, and storage of elements in different environments. We are focusing our efforts on the seeds of corn and soybeans, the two most commonly grown crops in the United States. The seeds are important not only as the component of the plant that gets used for food, but also as a summary tissue of many physiological processes that are important for plant growth. We also study model systems to understand basic processes and apply this knowledge to the crop plants.Ê

"Bernal-Mizrachi, Carlos"	Molecular Cell Biology				"The goal of my laboratory is to pursue a series of studies focused mainly on two mechanisms that we believe are critical to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in patients with Type 2 DM and prediabetes: Vitamin D deficiency and tissue glucocorticoid excess. Patients with prediabetes and Type 2 DM have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and hypertension compared to the general population. Animal and human studies have shown that vitamin D improves peripheral insulin action, suppresses the renin-angiotensin system and decreases vascular inflammatory factors; mechanisms responsible for increased blood pressure (BP). However, there is lack of evidence as to whether the increased prevalence of hypertension and atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes is truly influenced by vitamin D deficiency. Our laboratory is using multiple animal models, novel molecular biology techniques and clinical trials to assess whether alterations in the expression of genes related to vitamin D metabolism are responsible for the development of these diseases. Adipose and hepatic glucocorticoid excess in mice resembles metabolic syndrome, a poorly understood condition characterized by insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease. We are interested to find the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids induce hypertension and atherosclerosis. In the past, we have demonstrated that a nuclear transcription factor PPAR a (important for lipid metabolism), and hepatic afferent vagal nerve activation are required for glucocorticoid-induced hypertension and diabetes in mice. Now, we are using genetically engineered mice and classical physiology to characterize the interaction between lipid metabolism and glucocorticoid signaling in critical tissues responsible for the development of atherosclerosis. Identifying these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel therapies for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

We have developed a wide array of molecular genetic, genomic, cell biological and biochemical tools of the genome, and are applying these towards dissecting how the parasites carry out their infectious cycle in both mammals and the sand fly vector which transmits them. We are interested in parasite molecules which play key roles in antigenic variation, macrophage survival, and disease progression, many of which constitute the surface glycocalyx. As our work is carried directly in a serious pathogen, it is perhaps unsurprising that many findings have potential clinical applications. Several of the ÔvirulenceÕ pathways above as well as other metabolic pathways show great promise for development of selective chemotherapies.

One or more of these hormones is essential for gonadal development, and for maintaining pregnancy and thyroid function. Using site-directed mutagenesis, our laboratory investigates structural determinants that govern the unique post-translational modifications of the related placental and pituitary glycoprotein hormones. These hormones undergo specific modifications and have unique biologic activities. Together with DNA mediated transfection techniques, monoclonal antibody screening, and protein and carbohydrate characterization, the laboratory is examining the regions critical for chaperone interactions in the folding and the differential sorting of these heterodimeric hormones. Studies are also underway for determining the ligand determinants that are responsible for the transducing signals in the hormone-receptor complex. A critical feature of these hormones is their unique secretion patterns. LH is secreted through a regulated secretory pathway, i.e. it is released by secretagogue, whereas FSH is primarily secreted constitutively. The oligosaccharides on these glycoproteins are hormone specific. We are currently testing models addressing the hypothesis that the carbohydrates play a critical role in FSH/LH sorting. FSH-LH _ chimeras and point mutants are currently designed to identify sequences that govern their unique secretion patterns. Informative LH and FSH variants in cell-culture assays will be expressed in pituitaries from transgenic mice. The ability to reroute FSH and LH in vivo would represent an important model for gonadal dysfunction and potentially provide a novel way to examine normal and ultimately pathophysiological events in the human reproductive tract.

The concept of cognitive control is central to our notions of consciousness, agency, and will. Higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and short-term or working memory are thought to rely critically on control processes. Conversely, the loss of cognitive control is a major component of many neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. As such, I believe elucidating the mechanisms of cognitive control is a fundamental goal for psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. The ultimate goal of my own research program is to contribute to our understanding of how cognitive control emerges in the brain, in terms of the interactions between neural processing elements, and without recourse to &quot;homunculus&quot;-type explanations. Because of this goal, my research approach is both integrative and inter-disciplinary, combining behavioral studies, computational modeling, and cognitive neuroscience methods.
There are several major themes running through my research. A first theme is to determine the specialized functional contributions that different brain systems, such as the prefrontal cortex and midbrain dopamine system, make to cognitive control, and how these different systems might interact. A second theme is to explore how and why cognitive control functions break down in certain impaired populations, such as older adults and schizophrenia patients. A third theme is to demonstrate and understand the variability in cognitive control strategies that individuals adopt over time and across different task situations. A final theme is to explore individual variation in cognitive control function among healthy young adults, and how these individual differences might interact with putatively Ònon-cognitiveÓ factors such as emotional states, motivation, and personality.

"Buhler, Jeremy"	Computational and Systems Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics			"Detecting local similarities among biosequences is fundamental to the task of assigning identity, historical context, and putative function to parts of genomes. While efficient and sensitive similarity search algorithms such as BLAST have served the biological community well in the past, we must adapt these tools to meet emerging analytical needs in genomics. Exponential growth of both our sequence databases and our capacity to generate new sequence can obsolete methods that were ""fast enough"" in the past; moreover, new applications, such as discovering new protein families from metagenomic data or alignment of short reads with errors to a sequenced genome, pose bioinformatic challenges that require us to extend existing algorithms and to propose new ones.
My lab explores new algorithmic techniques for designing biosequence similarity search tools. We seek to anticipate the needs of the biological community for new tools, to establish firm theoretical foundations for the design of existing tools, and to discover techniques that make new classes of search problem feasible. For example, our work on the PROJECTION motif-finding algorithm and on Wang and Stormo`s PhyloNet motif search tool extended these tools to problem sizes and complexities that were previously beyond their scope. Our ongoing work on Mercury BLAST, an FPGA-accelerated engine for BLAST, seeks to exploit the low-level parallelism in today`s high-performance computing architectures to accelerate similarity search. We are also exploring challenges in clustering, assembling, and interpreting reads from metagenomic datasets, as well as fundamental questions of how to enable simpler, faster construction of new bioinformatics tools for high-performance computing architectures."

"Burkhalter, Andreas"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Neurosciences			"Many disorders of the visual system impair spatiotemporal processing. It is thought that this is due to abnormalities in the cortical network. In primate cortex, visual information is encoded in multiple functionally specialized areas which are connected to hierarchical processing streams, specialized for object recognition and spatial relationships. The structure and physiology of the synaptic circuits that underlie these functions are incompletely understood. Recent advances in labeling, recording and manipulating the activity of distinct types of neurons suggest that the mouse visual system in a suitable model for unraveling the underlying network. An important question is whether the mouse visual cortex is similar to that of primates and contains multiple modularly organized areas that are linked to distinct processing streams. If so, another important question is how these modules, areas and processing streams work together to create a unified representation of the world that can be flexibly changed by internal representations of the world to optimally guide behavioral goals.To investigate these questions we are employing a combination of anatomical, physiological and optogenetic techniques. For delineating area maps we are studying the regional distribution of molecular markers and use topographic mapping of connections and physiological recording of visual receptive fields. Multi-color viral tracing methods are employed to study the anatomical organization of cortical streams and areal hierarchies. Single unit recordings with electrode arrays are used to determine whether the areas are connected to different streams that process distinct visual information. To study the neuronal composition of feedforward and feedback circuits between lower and higher cortical areas we are using neuronal tracers and cell-type specific markers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. For determining the mechanisms of synaptic transmission in interareal circuits we are using laser photo stimulation of channelrhodopsin labeled feedforward and feedback connections and whole cell recording of synaptically connected inhibitory and excitatory neurons in brain slices.The results show that mouse visual cortex contains at least 11 visual areas, which are linked to distinct hierarchically organized streams that preferentially process spatial and temporal information. Our findings demonstrate that the mouse and primate visual systems share fundamental similarities, suggesting that the mouse is a suitable model for mechanistic studies of neurological disorders in humans.

To achieve this goal, my laboratory uses a wide array of tools to isolate endogenous opioid mechanisms of action to understand how different brain areas and circuits function in vivo. For example, we use three-dimensional anatomical mapping via multiplexed in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry to identify how opioids and their receptors are expressed or coexpressed with single cell resolution. We also employ selective genetic knockdown or rescue, opto- and chemogenetics, in vivo fiber photometry, 1-photon endoscopic imaging, and CRISPR-Cas9 techniques to isolate the primary mechanism through which opioids causally modulate systems of interest. Currently, my lab is examining how endogenous opioids shape affective or motivated behaviors across multiple neural circuits. Areas of particular interest include like nucleus accumbens insular cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray nucleus. We are also looking at how endogenous opioids interact with other neurochemicals (e.g., GABA/glutamate) to shape neural and behavioral outputs to better understand how opioids function as neuromodulators. Beyond the brain, we are investigating the mechanisms underlying opioid regulation of metabolism in peripheral tissues. Specifically, we are using genetic, CRISPR, optogenetic, and non-invasive near-infrared imaging approaches to isolate how opioids control insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in endocrine pancreas. Alongside these hypothesis driven studies, my lab is also interested in expanding the scope of existing technologies to better study neuropeptides. This has taken the form of the development of wireless optofluidic platforms, novel biosensors, and multiplexed dual color endoscopic imaging. Altogether, my lab seeks to understand how endogenous opioid systems regulate a variety of systems by using and developing cutting-edge technologies.

In spite of the remarkable technological advances in micro and nano-scale integration, the performance achieved by specialized biological sensing systems makes even the most advanced man-made systems of today look crude and primitive. At the fundamental level most of the sensory processing in biology is inherently ``analogÓ and efficiency arises out of exploitation of computing and sensing primitives inherent in the device physics, like diffusion or feedback regulation. Also, unlike man-made sensors which consider device and sensor noise as nuisances, biology has evolved to use non-linear sensing techniques to exploit noise to its advantage and operate at or below fundamental limits. We are researching novel neuromorphic architectures and processors, novel spiking neuron models, noise-exploitation techniques, and hybrid bio-silicon cyborg systems.Ê
Research in self-powered sensing and battery-less circuits and systems
Self-powered sensing refers to an energy scavenging paradigm where the operational power of a sensor is harvested directly from the signal being sensed. For example, a piezoelectric transducer could be used for sensing variations in mechanical strain and the energy in the strain variations could also be used for the computation and storage. As a result, the operation of the self-powered sensor can be asynchronous where events of interest can directly energize the computing and storage circuits. In this manner, the asynchronous sensor can continuously monitor for events of interest without experiencing any down-time, a feature that canÕt be guaranteed with conventional synchronous energy scavenging approaches. Our approach to self-powered sensing is to investigate analog non-volatile storage techniques that operate at fundamental limits of energy scavenging and hence can directly be energized by a transducer like a piezoelectric element. Based on this principle we have reported different variants of self-powered chipsets that can be used for health and usage monitoring of mechanically active parts like biomechanical implants and structures. We are also investigating perennial computing devices that can operate by harvesting energy from thermal noise and local field potential in the brain. Because the power levels of thermal noise are typically less than 1 femtowatt, conventional electronic cannot even operate, let alone scavenge energy. We have researching self-powered timers and neural activity recording devices that operate only using ambient thermal-noise.

Few are more extreme than the genome remodeling of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. This organism eliminates nearly 15 megabases of its germline DNA from the somatic nucleus during its development. Our lab aims to understand the regulation of this massive genome reorganization using a combination of genetic, molecular, and cellular biology approaches to uncover how ~6000 DNA segments are selectively excised. Our current model is built on the observations that bi-directional germline transcription leads to the generation of 28-30 base RNA molecules (scan RNAs) that then target specific chromatin modification(s) to the homologous locus. The DNA rearrangement machinery recognizes the modified chromatin state and eliminates the targeted DNA segment. These studies will certainly provide fundamental insight into RNAi-related mechanisms that direct chromatin modifications that are critical for transcriptional gene silencing and heterochromatin formation in eukaryotes. Underlying this proposal is a goal to understand how RNA molecules can communicate genetic information between the parental and developing genomes, which has great potential to reveal novel roles for RNA in epigenetic programming. Additionally, we believe many of the DNA segments targeted for elimination are important for germline chromosome structure, and thus understanding how the cell specifically recognizes these sequences will contribute general knowledge of mechanisms ensuring chromosome stability that are essential to prevent aberrant rearrangements."

Altered neuromodulation is associated with most psychiatric disorders, major neurodegenerative disorders, and neuromodulatory systems are targets of almost all drugs of abuse. While specific behaviors have been linked to specific neuromodulators, and while many neuromodulator receptors and their downstream signaling pathways are known, how neuromodulators regulate behavior remains enigmatic.The knowledge gap exists because our understanding of molecular signaling networks remains largely a static diagram of connections between molecules. Our laboratory attempts to bridge molecular neuroscience and animal behavior by elucidating the spatial and temporal dynamics of biological signals, because they carry critical information that explain subsequent modifications of cells, circuits, and behavior.Specifically, we aim to understand how spatial and temporal features of neuromodulators and intracellular signals contribute to the functions of neuromodulators and functions of sleep. Understanding these important features will ultimately help treat psychiatric disorders.

"Cho, Jaehyung"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Immunology	Molecular Cell Biology		"Project 1. Role of extracellular thiol-modifying machinery in arterial thrombosis Mounting evidence indicates that oxidation or reduction of allosteric disulfide bonds in plasma proteins and cell surface molecules induces conformational changes and alters their functions in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and PDI family member oxidoreductases catalyze the modification of allosteric disulfide bonds. We demonstrated that platelet-released PDI directly interacts with cell surface molecules, such as _3 integrin and glycoprotein Ib_ (GPIb_), during cell activation and promotes platelet adhesive function in arterial thrombosis and thromboinflammation (Kim et al. Blood 2013; Li et al. Circulation 2019). While these results demonstrate the essential role of PDI in the disease process, it is unknown how intravascular PDI activity is regulated under thrombotic conditions. We have found that endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1_ (ERO1_), a key oxidase of PDI in the ER, is released from activated intravascular cells such as platelets and plays a critical role in arteriolar thrombosis but not hemostasis. Using ERO1_ knockout (KO) and conditional KO (CKO) mice, blocking antibodies, and small-molecule inhibitors which my lab has recently developed, we will identify cell surface molecules targeted by extracellular ERO1_ using proteomics, unravel the role of ERO1_ in modifying allosteric disulfide bonds in cell surface molecules, and determine the presence and function of extracellular ERO1_-thiol isomerase (e.g., PDI) redox-relay signaling in arterial thrombosis. There is evidence that hypoxia stimulates platelet activity and contributes to the pathophysiology of cerebral and arterial thrombosis. Because hypoxia up-regulates the expression of ERO1_, our long-term goal is to elucidate novel roles of ERO1_ and thiol isomerases in ischemia/reperfusion-induced injuries, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Project 2. Mechanisms regulating neutrophil recruitment to sites of vascular inflammation Neutrophils are essential for innate immunity, yet excessive recruitment to sites of inflammation causes severe tissue damage. Furthermore, adherent neutrophils support adhesion of other blood cells such as platelets and red blood cells, leading to cell-cell aggregation and vascular occlusion. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating the interactions of neutrophils with endothelial cells and other blood cells is of great importance for designing effective therapies to attenuate inflammatory conditions without impairing host defense. We demonstrated that the AKT2-NOX2 signaling axis promotes the ligand-binding function of neutrophil _M_2 integrin and platelet GPIb_ to induce cell-cell interactions under thromboinflammatory conditions, including sterile inflammation and ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury (Li et al. J Clin Invest 2014; Kim et al. Blood 2015). In particular, our animal studies revealed that intravascular neutrophil-platelet interactions directly contribute to vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease (SCD), which is a trigger for pain crisis and acute chest syndrome in patients (Barazia et al. Blood 2015; Kim et al. Haematologica 2017). In our latest studies, we demonstrated that blocking intravascular PDI activity attenuates these cell-cell interactions and vaso-occlusion in SCD mice (Li et al. Circulation 2019). We have identified a crucial role of AKT2 in promoting calcium release and influx during neutrophil activation. Aided by proteomics and mass spectrometric analysis, we will discover AKT2-regulated target molecules controlling calcium mobilization in neutrophils under inflammatory conditions and to identify the AKT2 phosphorylation sites on the candidate molecules. Since NOX2-generated reactive oxygen species alter the local redox environment, our long-term project conducted in relation to though independent of Project 1 is to explore how the AKT2-NOX2 signaling axis influences the activities of extracellular ERO1_ and thiol isomerases in inflammatory disease. Furthermore, we have found that in addition to PDI, extracellular ERO1_ and other thiol isomerases contribute to vaso-occlusion in patients with SCD. We will determine the role of intravascular ERO1_ and thiol isomerases in regulating neutrophil adhesive function in SCD. Importantly, we will test the ability of novel ERO1_ blocking antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors to attenuate vaso-occlusion-mediated events in SCD. Our studies will be of substantial clinical importance by providing insight into the design of novel therapeutic strategies for SCD patients. Project 3. Role of transcription regulators in platelet activation and thrombosis Anucleate platelets can synthesize proteins using mRNAs and microRNAs under disease conditions. Intriguingly, platelets contain transcriptional regulators, which could be transferred from megakaryocytes during platelet production. Our recent studies provide the first evidence that the mRNA and protein of Downstream Regulatory Element Antagonist Modulator (DREAM, a transcriptional repressor and a positive regulator of NF-_B) are present in platelets and that platelet DREAM promotes the activity of phosphoinositide-3-kinase during platelet activation and arterial thrombosis (Kim et al. Blood 2017). Our work has identified DREAM as a novel target for anti-thrombotic agents. Furthermore, platelets express toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR4 and their downstream signaling molecules, such as NF-_B. However, their roles in platelet function remain poorly understood. Therefore, we will investigate the role of TLR and NF-_B signaling in platelet activation and arterial thrombosis.

"Choi, Kyunghee"	Cancer Biology	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Immunology		"We study hematopoietic and endothelial cell development and their interplay in cancer. We have expertise in hematopoietic, vascular, and stem cell biology, as well as stem cell applications. Notably, we focus on how hematopoietic and vascular systems are established during embryogenesis. Our contributions to this area have been delineating molecular and cellular pathways that control commitment from mesoderm to hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Specifically, the demonstration of the ""Hemangioblast"" is a significant contribution to the field, as this study was the first to show experimentally the presence of the long hypothesized common hematopoietic and endothelial cell progenitor ""Hemangioblast"" (Choi et al., Development, 1998). Subsequent studies have focused on transcription factors and signaling pathways that contribute to hemangioblast development and differentiation. Notably, we have shown that the ETS transcription factor ETV2 functions at the earliest stage of the hemangiogenic cell lineage development. We reported the first paper on this gene's knockout phenotype, which shows a complete defect in hematopoietic and vascular development (Lee et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2008). Subsequently, we reported the ETV2 ChIP-seq study to demonstrate its essential function in establishing the hemangiogenic program (Liu et al., EMBO Reports, 2015). We recently reported that hemangiogenic fate is specified not by the onset of Etv2 expression but by a threshold-dependent mechanism, in which VEGF-FLK1 signaling plays an instructive role by controlling Etv2 threshold expression (Zhao and Choi, Nature Communications, 2017). Notably, the analysis of the fate of Flk1+ cells by single-cell RNA-sequencing suggests that the default fate of these cells is smooth muscle differentiation. This study provides a potential new regulatory mechanism that operates early in development on Flk1+ cells (Zhao and Choi, Development, 2019). Currently, we are integrating epigenetics into the study of hemangiogenesis (Wu et al., Cell Rep., 2020). We recently reported that Etv2 is reactivated in hematopoietic and endothelial cells upon injury. Importantly, Etv2 reactivation is required for vascular (Park et al., ATVB, 2016) and hematopoietic regeneration (Xu et al., JEM, 2017). We are currently investigating the mechanisms by which tumors control tumor immunity by exploiting endothelial cells locally and distally to favor the tumor progression (Kabir et al., JCI Insight, 2018; Kabir et al., Science Translational Medicine, 2021)."
"Christopher, Matthew"	Cancer Biology	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology		"The principle goal of our lab is to use genomic and molecular biology techniques to improve outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematopoietic malignancies. We are currently pursuing three projects that focus on different aspects of leukemia pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

In the first project, we are studying the role of the transcription factor WT1 in hematologic malignancies. Expressed widely during development, WT1 is not normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, however it is expressed at high levels in a wide range of blood cancers. In addition, roughly 10% of patients with AML have mutations in WT1, and up to 25% of patients with Acute promyelocytic leukemia (a subtype of AML associated with the PML-RARA fusion
mutation) have co-occuring mutations in WT1, suggesting that WT1 mutations may also contribute to disease progression in these cases. Through lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR-mediated gene disruption, we have generated gain and loss-of-function models of WT1 in both mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Interestingly, we have observed that introduction of PML-RARA and a wide range of other leukemia-associated mutations in HPC leads to a rapid and robust activation of WT1 expression in these cells, suggesting that WT1 activation may be an early event in leukemia progression.

Our second project is a clinical-translational project testing whether a sensitive, next-generation sequencing platform can predict leukemia relapse after transplantation before it becomes clinically evident. In a preliminary experiment using a PCR amplicon sequencing approach, leukemic variants could be detected in bone marrow samples obtained ~6 months before clinical relapse. To extend these studies, we have made use of an institutional, clinically validated error-corrected sequencing platform (Haloplex, Illumina) to test if AML relapse after transplantation can be detected with improved lead time compared to single tandem repeat (STR) testing, the method used for early detection of relapse at the majority of centers. We are currently testing this approach retrospectively on samples from 40 patients who relapsed after transplant and 40 non-relapsed controls. Finally, the third main project builds on our recent observation that in AML cells from patients relapsing after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), a number of immune genes are significantly dysregulated, including genes involved in innate immunity, cell trafficking and adhesion, and-strikingly-genes encoding MHC class II (MHCII). Since HCT is considered to work in part through donor T cell reactivity toward recipient hematopoietic cells (the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; effect), downregulation of MHCII and loss of antigen presentation by AML cells to donor T cells may contribute to AML relapse after HCT. Consistent with this, AML samples from patients who relapsed after stem cell transplantation with low MHCII expression failed to stimulate third-party donor T cells in vitro, in contrast to relapse AML cells with normal MHCII expression. Intriguingly, we observed decreased expression of CIITA, a transcriptional transactivator that regulates MHCII genes, associated with increased DNA methylation in a CIITA regulatory region in intron 1, suggesting a model wherein epigenetic changes in the CIITA locus that occur after transplantation leads to downregulation of MHCII genes, contributing to relapse. Most importantly, downregulation of CIITA and MHCII genes was reversible after treatment with interferon gamma, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to restore MHCII expression and AML cell sensitivity to the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Currently, we are using mouse models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation to test the effect of CIITA overexpression and deletion on MHCII expression and the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Finally, we are testing whether restoration of MHCII expression on relapsed AML cells restores sensitivity to donor T cells in a pre-clinical, mouse xenograft model of AML. Future experiments will make use of these models to explore the roles of innate immune and cell adhesion genes in posttransplantation relapse."

"Cirrito, John"	Neurosciences				"Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation within the brain extracellular space, as toxic oligomers and plaques, is strongly believed to be the primary cause of Alzheimer`s disease (AD). My lab focuses on understanding the metabolism Abeta within the brain extracellular fluid, or interstitial fluid (ISF). We developed a novel in vivo microdialysis technique that enables us to specifically measure ISF Abeta within the brains of living and awake wildtype and APP transgenic mice. The technique permits hourly sampling of Abeta for several days, thus providing kinetic information about how A_ levels change over time under various settings such as aging, behavior, drug treatment, and genetic manipulation. We recently discovered that synaptic activity is a critical regulator of Abeta production in the living brain; as synaptic activity increases ISF Abeta levels rapidly increase and vice versa as synaptic activity declines. This occurs following pharmacologic manipulation of synaptic activity as well as during physiological fluctuations in activity such as sleep/wake cycles or stress. Synaptic transmission causes more clathrin-mediated endocytosis within the presynaptic terminal as synaptic vesicle membrane recycles. As this occurs, APP is internalized into endosomes where Abeta is produced followed by secretion into the ISF. APP is found within the axonal compartment as well as the dendritic compartment. Postsynaptic signaling mechanisms, through a wide variety of receptors including NMDA, muscarinic acetylcholine, and serotonin receptors can modulate APP processing and alter Abeta levels as well. One aspect of our current research is focused on postsynaptic signaling mechanisms that decrease Abeta generation including identification of effectors on the cell surface and the signaling pathways within the neuron that impact Abeta production. Activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway decreases Abeta levels in vivo. ERK can be activated by a multitude of extracellular ligands, including NMDA receptors and serotonin receptors. We can demonstrate the agents that increase serotonin signaling, such as SSRI antidepressants, decrease A_ levels in the mouse brain which entirely depends on ERK signaling. Inhibiting ERK or MEK (another step in the ERK pathway) completely blocks the SSRI-dependent decrease in Abeta. Work by a collaborator at Washington University, Dr. Yvette Sheline, suggests that SSRI antidepressants reduce plaque load in humans as well. Our hope is that understanding the pathways that control Abeta levels will help us understand risk factors of AD as well as provide new therapeutic targets. My lab is also developing several new techniques, including in vivo synaptic plasticity assays to determine how various forms of Abeta impact synaptic transmission in a physiological setting. We are also developing new protein-specific electrochemical technologies to measure Abeta in the scale of seconds or milliseconds as opposed to hours currently available with our microdialysis technique. Such an approach would allow us to measure Abeta release from neurons in real-time and further define the complex relationship between synaptic activity and Abeta generation.

Using single cell RNA-sequencing on the developing mouse and human retina (Clark and Stein-O'Brien, et al, 2019; Neuron; Lu and Shiau, et al., 2020; Dev Cell), we are beginning to understand the transcriptional signature of retinal progenitors across development and during the process of retinal neurogenesis. We have identified numerous genes with unknown retinal function that display both dynamic and temporally restricted expression patterns that we hypothesize to be important in the regulation of retinal development. Using a suite of moderate to high-throughput techniques, we aim to identify the mechanisms by which these genes function to control retinal neurogenesis and cell fate specification. Current efforts are focused on examining similarities and differences in retinal neurogenesis and cell type specification across vertebrate species and how progenitor quiescence is induced.

The first vulnerable neuron population to be identified was GABAergic interneurons, followed by the staging of neuron loss within the thalamocortical system, which revealed the thalamus as an unexpected pathological target in these disorders. We also demonstrated the selective effects upon populations of cerebellar neurons, and have continued this work to reveal an unexpectedly severe pathology in the brainstem and spinal cord. More recently we have revealed the involvement of the peripheral, autonomic and enteric nervous systems and are investigating their contribution to disease outcome.3. Following these discoveries we have been working to understand the selective nature of neuron loss in the NCLs and what might influence this. By comparing the relative timing and distribution of neuron loss to storage material accumulation, astrocytosis and microglial activation we have learnt fundamental lessons about thestaging of NCL pathogenesis and how it differs between disease subtypes. There appears to be no direct correlation between neuron loss and storage material accumulation. Instead there is a much closer correlationbetween glial activation and neuron loss, with either astrocytosis or microglial activation consistently precedingneuron loss, leading us to investigate the nature of neuron:glial interactions and how they may be compromised. Our work has provided evidence that glia are dysfunctional and may directly compromise neuron health, resulting in neuron loss. These studies have highlighted that while different forms of NCL share broad pathological similarities they differ fundamentally in many respects. 4. We have been using the disease landmarks gained through these neuropathological studies to test the efficacy of a variety of pre-clinical experimental therapies. Indeed, we are increasingly asked to undertake this work by a wide-network of academic and industrial collaborators around the world. As such, we have played key roles in studies of gene therapy, neural stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement, and a variety of small molecule approaches. These include glutamate receptor antagonists, immunosuppressants, and antiinflammatory compounds, with an increasing focus on trying different combinations of experimental therapies in order to potential increase their efficacy. Most recently we identified that treating the brain and spinal cord has a powerful synergistic effect in a mouse model of Cln1 disease. This work has led to several clinical trials including that of mycophenolate mofetil in Cln3 disease, neural stem cell transplants in Cln1 and Cln2 disease, and a successful enzyme eplacement trial in Cln2 disease, which has just been approved by the FDA and EMA as the first ever treatment for CLN2 disease."

While these signals can be encoded by receptors and channels in the nerves at your fingertip, they must be properly integrated to generate complex sensory perceptions, like the relief of itch by scratching or pleasure from a gentle touch. However, they can also be transformed into debilitating forms of allodynia, or ""other pain,"" following nerve damage. The Copits Lab studies how different types of neurons encoding somatosensory modalities are assembled into functional circuits. Here we combine transcriptomics with CRISPR-Cas genome editing to identify molecules that regulate synaptic wiring of sensory neurons into the brain and spinal cord and understand how alterations in these circuits impact sensory behaviors. In parallel, we are developing new optical and genetic tools to better understand circuit dynamics, with emphasis on neurodevelopmental disorders and chronic pain states.

"Dell, Anthony"	"Evolution, Ecology and Population Biology"				"My research fuses metabolic ecology, movement ecology, and community ecology to address basic and applied questions in biology. This involves studying how the traits of organisms (physiology, body size, body temperature, etc.) interact with the physical environment (light, moisture, temperature, habitat dimensionality, etc.) to drive behavior and movement; how this influences the strength and outcome of species interactions; and how species interactions shape ecological systems and even global patterns of biodiversity. Understanding these relationships requires study across taxa, habitats, and levels of biological organization from individual physiology to ecosystem ecology. These issues are relevant to many questions in ecology and evolution, including those centered on behavior, species interactions, disease, community functioning and stability, and global change. More recently, mywork explores how humans interact with the natural world, with the goal of producing science that can inform management and policy.
I employ a range of methods in my research, including field monitoring, field and laboratory experiments, analysis of published data, and mechanistic theory. I have long had the goal of creating better methods for the remote (non-destructive) monitoring of ecological systems that not only quantify which species are present, but also their morphology (e.g., body size, body temperature, metabolic rate), behavior (e.g., activity budget, speed, foraging strategy), and rate of ecological interactions. Recent advances in imaging (RGB, near-infrared, thermal, sonar, 4Dcameras, etc.) and computer vision now enable unprecedented quantification of the lives of untagged animals from diverse taxa, habitats, and environmental contexts (see Dell et al. 2014). I use these technologies in the laboratory and field to collect high-resolution movement and behavioral data that I analyze with automated tracking and behavioral phenotyping software. Currently I am able to track almost 100 unmarked individuals in a diversity of environmental contexts, including day and night, terrestrial and aquatic. I anticipate my use of these approaches increasing in the future, as the technology continues to advance and become more accessible. Ultimately, I believe these technologies will fundamentally change the nature of ecological research, much as it has done for molecular biology.

We are actively interrogating lysosome biology in multiple cell types and disease states including heart failure, atherosclerosis, AlzheimerÕs pathogenesis, and diabetes. My lab has uncovered evidence for dysregulation of the lysosome machinery as a major contributor to cardiac myocyte loss in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our work has also extended these findings to uncover evidence for lysosome dysfunction in various CNS cell types in AlzheimerÕs disease and in pancreatic beta cells in obesity-induced diabetes, underscoring the importance of acquired lysosome dysfunction in triggering multiple chronic diseases that are predisposed by common risk factors. As the PI or co-investigator on studies funded through National funding mechanisms, we have developed the expertise and tools to experimentally perturb and evaluate lysosome biology, concomitantly with disease modeling in in vitro and in vivo systems. Our overarching goal is to develop therapies to harness lysosome function in treating heart failure, cardiometabolic conditions and Alzheimer's disease.

Both as basic science and for tissue engineering it is important to understand the mechanisms of remodeling.

These tissue models can be used to study both normal and pathological cellular and tissue mechanical functions, e.g., regulation of myosin-dependent contractile force in smooth and cardiac muscle and nonmuscle cells by agonists binding to cell surface receptors as well as by interactions with ECM that trigger changes of cellular contractile force.

"Faccio, Roberta"	Cancer Biology	Immunology	Molecular Cell Biology		"Excessive bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis and some bone metastasis is mostly due to an abnormal activation of the immune system leading to stimulation of osteoclasts (OCs). Our goal is to discover common signaling molecules affecting the osteo-immune system and study their impact on normal and pathological bone loss. We have identified a novel role for the immunomodulatory protein PLC?2 as central mediator of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, independent of PLC?1. OCs, the principal bone resorbing cells, develop from bone marrow macrophages primarily under the influence of two major regulators: M-CSF and RANKL, and less understood costimulatory factors that act via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing receptors on OC precursor cells. Our data indicate that targeted deletion of PLC?2 leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype due to defective OC recruitment and function. Thus, the interest of my lab is to 1) identify structural domains of PLC?2 required for OC differentiation and understand the mechanism leading to PLC?2 activation, but not PLC?1, in the bone resorbing cells; 2) examine the interaction of PLC?2 with element of the OC cytoskeleton and the av§3 integrin during bone resorption and study the role of PLC?2 in OC activation and bone erosion in vivo; 3) considering the importance of PLC?2 in regulation of B cell mediated immune responses and osteoclastogenesis, determine the relative PLC?2-dependent contribution of B and T cells in the development of inflammation and bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis; and 4) study the role of the of PLC?2 in the progression of breast cancer induced bone metastases. These studies might unveil novel OC regulatory mechanisms and provide the basis for new antiresorptive therapies in the context of inflammatory bone loss and bone cancer metastases.

"Ferguson, Thomas"	Immunology	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"My laboratory specializes in the mechanisms of cell death, cell survival, and the consequences of these processes on the immune and visual systems. This unique perspective has allowed us to make many important contributions to understanding the molecular basis of blinding eye diseases and the relationship between the eye and the immune system. We were the first to describe FasL (CD95L) as a mediator of immune privilege in the eye, where expression of this protein on ocular cells induces apoptosis in invading inflammatory cells. This protects the visual axis from damaging inflammation. FasL expression is also critical to the success of corneal transplants. We were first to determine that only certain subtypes of macrophages promoted angiogenesis in AMD models, while others were inhibitory. We have also explored the role of the immune system in models of AMD and are exploring the idea that targeting the immune privilege might lead to effective therapies for retinal disease. This laboratory also has considerable expertise in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells and the impact of this process on the immune response. We are now putting our expertise (and significant effort) toward understanding the role of autophagy in the functions of the eye and CNS, as well as examining the consequences of the deletion of crucial autophagy genes in the cells of the eye. We have shown that autophagy is important for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytosis of photoreceptors outer segments, the RPE visual cycle, and the regulation of phototransduction in the rod photoreceptors. Recently, we demonstrated that cones uniquely utilize autophagic mechanisms to maintain structure and function. Specifically, induced autophagy protects cone-mediated vision (daytime vision) from light and metabolic stress; while basal autophagy (in the form of mitophagy) prevents cell damage and maintains cone energy supplies by continuously removing oxidatively damaged mitochondria. 
Current projects in the lab: Mller glial cells and Immune privilege of the eye: We are undertaking studies to determine the precise role of Mller glial cell autophagy in the immune privilege of the eye. Our approach utilizes cell-type specific knockouts of essential autophagy genes coupled with ocular inflammatory models of retinal disease. scRNA-seq analysis is employed to study gene expression in Mller cells to understand the molecular basis of immune privilege. Mller glial cell phagocytosis: In phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages and RPE cells) phagocytosis of extracellular material (bacteria, photoreceptor outer segments) engages elements of autophagy pathway. This process is termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (or LAP) and disruption of the pathway can lead to autoimmunity and vision loss. Muller cells are also phagocytic, thus, we examining the role of LAP in Mller cells by testing the idea that autophagy supports phagocytosis in Mller cells promoting their anti-inflammatory properties. Autophagy and cone photoreceptor function: The function of cones as our daytime photoreceptors depends critically on the rapid recovery of their sensitivity after exposure to bright light, a process known as dark adaptation. We are studying the role of autophagy in cone-driven photopic dark adaptation. Recent studies suggest that without autophagy cone dark adaptation is slowed. When autophagy is enhanced in normal cones by systemic starvation dark adaptation is accelerated. Whether autophagy regulates dark adaptation at the level of the visual cycle or synaptic transmission is currently under study.Ê

One additional goal of our research is to understand how telomeres are organized and regulated. Telomeres can form distinct globules or assemble into larger structures. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that impart telomeres with their globular and dynamic character is key to explaining how telomeres shelter the ends of chromosomes.In our studies we employ a broad range of techniques, ranging from classical biochemistry approaches to quantitative biophysical techniques both in ensemble and at single-molecule level.

The ultimate goal of Dr. GordonÕs work is to use these precise, individual-specific characterizations to 1) help improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of neurological disorders, particularly traumatic brain injury; and 2) improve the efficacy of brain stimulation-based interventions such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

"Gordon, Jeffrey"	Computational and Systems Biology	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"Mutually beneficial relationships between microbes and animals are a pervasive feature of life on our microbe-dominated planet. We are no exception: the total number of microbes that colonize our body surfaces exceeds our total number of somatic and germ cells by 10-fold. The majority of our symbionts reside in our intestines (10-100 trillion!), where they provide us with traits we have not had to evolve on our own. In this sense, we should view ourselves as a composite of bacterial, archaeal and human cells, our genetic landscape as a summation of the genes embedded in our own human genome and the genes embedded in the genomes (ÔmicrobiomeÕ) of our microbial partners, and our metabolic features as an amalgamation of human and microbial attributes. We are interested in the following questions: What are the genomic and metabolic foundations of our mutually beneficial relationships with gut microbes? How do we acquire our microbiota and microbiome? How much diversity is there in our microbiomes: do all humans share an identifiable ÔcoreÕ microbiome? How is the human microbiome evolving as a function of our changing diets, lifestyle, and biosphere? How does it contribute to health and our predispositions to various diseases? How can we intentionally manipulate our microbial communities to optimize their performance in the context of an individual, or a population? To address these questions, we are sequencing the genomes of 100 representative members of the human gut microbiota so that we can make predictions about what attributes they possess and what contributions they make to their microbial communities and hosts. We use germ-free normal and genetically engineered mice, colonized with defined collections of sequenced wild-type (or mutant) bacteria and archaea that normally reside in the human gut, to simultaneously monitor host and microbial responses to colonization. We employ a variety of experimental and computational techniques, including metagenomics (sequencing whole microbial community DNA to define its gene content), functional genomics, and mass-spec-based metabolomics, so that we can compare and contrast the composition of the gut microbial community and its microbiome in normal mice and mice that serve as models for common human diseases. We are taking the insights we glean from mouse models and validating them in humans, including mono- and dizygotic twin pairs and their mothers and siblings. One key issue we are addressing is whether differences in our gut microbial ecology affect our pre-disposition to obesity or malnutrition. These latter studies involve humans living in developing countries located in various parts of the world.

"Green, Abby"	Cancer Biology	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics		"Overview:
Cancer develops through accumulation of DNA mutations and structural aberrations collectively known as genome instability. Genome damage in adult-onset malignancies can be traced to exogenous carcinogens or simply the process of aging. However, pediatric cancers do not arise as a result of aging or exogenous genotoxic agents. We are interested in the etiology of genome instability in pediatric cancers and the resulting genome-protective responses, also called DNA damage responses, that are activated. Our long-term goal is to identify factors within DNA damage response signaling pathways that represent therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to develop new treatment options for children with cancer.

Our current investigations are centered around two etiologies of endogenous DNA damage in leukemia: (1) APOBEC3 enzymes, DNA cytosine deaminases that are expressed at high levels in acute myeloid leukemia, and (2) MLL (KMT2A) gene rearrangements that drive infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Projects:
1. Functional whole-genome knock out screen to evaluate synthetic lethality with APOBEC3A expression in leukemia. 
2. Impact of APOBEC3A on DNA replication.
3. DNA damage responses elicited by MLL gene rearrangements in infant leukemia.
4. Impact of APOBEC3 enzymes on normal and malignant hematopoiesis.

A major hypothesis of the lab is that autophagy, a catabolic mechanism involving lysosomal degradation becomes reprogrammed during sepsis and contributes to the changes in cellular composition.  An unexpected finding is that autophagy is powerfully influenced by circadian rhythms.  Our research seeks to understand the connection between circadian disruption during sepsis and the reprogramming of autophagy.  We hope this research will lead to better functional recoveries after critical illness.  We particularly focus on lung injury using animal models and are in the process of extending our observations to blood samples from critically ill patients."

"Herrlich, Andreas"	Molecular Cell Biology				"The Herrlich Lab has a broad interest in Interorgan communication mechanisms in Health and Disease. Our current work focuses on the role of remote inflammation in secondary organ complications in kidney disease in the kidney-heart, kidney-lung, and kidney-brain axis. In particular, we are interested in how tissue injury in the kidney induces remote inflammation in secondary organs and how this influences organ function, immune memory and response to further direct injury in the secondary organ.Background: The foundation of organismal physiology is that organs ÒtalkÓ to each other in order to establish and maintain homeostasis of the organism. In recent decades, genetics and other studies in model organisms have revealed the existence of novel unanticipated interorgan communication networks (ICNs) as the bases of physiological functions, for example between the kidney, gut, brain, liver, and muscle. These ICNs can be of endocrine and/or neuronal nature, and also involve neuroimmune and neuroendocrine interactions. These novel findings challenged the previously siloed organ-centric view in the study of most physiological functions in mammals, and provided novel understanding of the pathogenesis of crippling acute as well as chronic diseases that are common and represent current major public health challenges. Diseases that seemingly affect one organ but are in fact caused in large part by disruption of regulations occurring outside this organ, so-called secondary organ complications, include for example diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, acute and chronic kidney disease, gastro-intestinal disorders, cancer and metastases, muscle wasting, and age-related memory loss, among many others. It is these secondary organ complications that drive most of the morbidity and mortality. Interorgan communication networks that drive secondary organ complications in complex diseases remain largely unknown. The Herrlich Lab identified an immune-regulatory molecule, circulating osteopontin, that is released by the injured kidney and causes remote lung inflammation with respiratory failure (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm5900).Ê

Utilization of transgenic and knockout mice has demonstrated that apoE and a molecule called apoJ/clusterin play critical roles in vivo in the formation of amyloid and its toxicity and that apoE4 is most likely an AD risk factor via its effects on Abeta conformation and toxicity.  Recent work with anti-Abeta antibodies demonstrates a novel mechanism in which antibodies can act as an ""Abeta sink"" in the plasma and has exciting potential to lead to new diagnostic and treatment methods for AD.

"Huang, Henry"	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis				"RNA viruses have high mutation rates and large population sizes that produce an astonishing diversity of variants that allow them to adapt rapidly to a particular lifecycle, conceivably to become optimal, such that the extant wildtype sequence is more fit than any variants derived from it.Analyses of viral sequences show that significant portions of their proteins are extremely well conserved: frequently shared by all viruses in the same genus. The corresponding RNA sequences typically contain many synonymous changes, indicating that mutations do occur at these sites, but no amino acid changes became fixed, suggesting that no neutral nor beneficial nonsynonymous changes exist at these sites.We use Sindbis virus as a model system to test if RNA viruses are indeed extremely well-adapted, and thus largely resistant to change. We examined the viral promoter that is used for the production of the subgenomic mRNA synthesis, using in vivo evolution and mutagenesis approaches, to show that across most of the promoter, the wildtype sequence is the most fit; i.e., the promoter is essentially optimal. Similar approaches will be used to test if much of the protein sequence of the viruses are similarly optimal. The results to date suggest a novel and general approach for designing antiviral drugs, by targeting the conserved protein and RNA sequences of the viruses. It promises to provide broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that are effective against the virus and that have minimal impact on host processes, with very low probabilities of drug-resistance.

In the vertebrate CNS, glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane underlie the transmission of information at excitatory synapses. Our goal is to provide a better understanding of synapses by determining the properties of glutamate receptors and of the channels that they control. We use electrophysiological recordings to study the activation and desensitization of the receptors following rapid application of glutamate. We also study compounds that block the glutamate binding site or physically occlude the ion pore. More recently, we have concentrated on a subtype of glutamate receptor that exhibits a unique form of desensitization. Comparison of the different receptor subtypes should lead to a clearer picture of how the binding of glutamate operates the channels.A second major goal of my lab is to understand the control of neuronal differentiation. We study the properties of neurons derived from human and mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells. We have shown that mouse ES-derived neurons express voltage-gated Na, K, and Ca channels, as well as channels gated by glutamate, GABA and glycine. Within two to three weeks after induction, some of the cells form excitatory synapses, whereas others form inhibitory connections. Using antibodies GAP43 and MAP-2 we have demonstrated the segregation of these proteins into separate axonal and somatodendritic compartments. In both their physiological properties and their ability to establish a polarized phenotype the differentiated mouse ES cells strongly resemble neurons from the CNS. Studies of human ES cell differentiation are ongoing.

His work as utilized a unique blend of a powerful genetic system with x-ray crystallography, protein chemistry, high resolution electron microscopy, immunology and cell biology to study the molecular details of host-pathogen interactions that occur during urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by E. coli.  He has become a worldÕs authority in issues relating to the structure and function of adhesive fibers called pili that play critical and unexpected roles in host-pathogen interactions. Studying UTIs, he found that bacterial entry into epithelial cells of the bladder provides a safe haven for bacterial persistence by activating the formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs).  Elucidation of the IBC program is changing the way UTIs are evaluated and treated and is re-shaping models of bacterial infections in general.  His studies are teaching us fundamental aspects of bladder physiology that have implications for normal epithelial renewal and bladder cancer.  He also is investigating amyloid-like fibers, called curli, produced by E. coli.  This work has implications for the pathology of AlzheimerÕs and other amyloid diseases.  Work in his lab is spawning new technologies to design novel vaccines and anti-microbial therapeutics that will block the ability of bacteria to adhere to host tissues and prevent their ability to establish infections.

"Jackrel, Meredith"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology	Neurosciences		"We use protein engineering and directed evolution to develop specialized molecular machines to reverse the protein misfolding implicated in human disease. In neurodegenerative diseases such as ParkinsonÕs disease (PD), AlzheimerÕs disease (AD), and HuntingtonÕs disease (HD), specific proteins misfold to take on the amyloid conformation. While traditionally viewed as an intractable and highly toxic protein conformation, amyloid is not always toxic. In fact, yeast employ amyloid for beneficial purposes and have evolved pathways to construct and disassemble amyloid. We are interested in reformulating this pathway and applying it to target human disease. The protein controlling this pathway in yeast is Hsp104, and in yeast Hsp104 disaggregates proteins from amyloid fibrils, pre-amyloid oligomers, and disordered aggregates. However, Hsp104 has only limited activity against amyloid fibrils comprised of proteins such as _-synuclein and A_ (implicated in PD and AD, respectively), as it does not ordinarily encounter these proteins. Thus, we aim to enhance Hsp104 activity and re-engineer Hsp104 substrate specificity. We use yeast as a model system because Hsp104 is present in yeast and powerful genetic tools are available to manipulate yeast. Also, expression of disease-associated substrates in yeast results in the accumulation of aggregated proteins that confer toxicity, which recapitulates their pathologies in human disease and has empowered the identification of genetic risk factors in humans. Using these models, we have developed a series of Hsp104 variants that potently disassemble TDP-43, FUS, and _-synuclein aggregates and amyloids that are implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and PD. Our work is the first example of using protein engineering to restore proteostasis. The variants we have developed suppress the toxicity of these misfolded proteins and also clear preformed aggregates, allowing the substrates to return to their proper localization. Certain variants potently suppress neurodegeneration in a C. elegans PD model and reverse aggregation in mammalian fibroblasts. In addition to their possible therapeutic applications, these variants might be employed as chemical biology probes to study the mechanism of protein-misfolding disorders. Also by better understanding the mechanism by which Hsp104 disassembles amyloid, new strategies to eliminate amyloid might be developed.
Our first generation variants are highly promising, but require further tuning to improve their characteristics. Thus we employ protein engineering and directed evolution to tune the activity of Hsp104 and other chaperones in order to develop protein remodeling factors with desired properties. We predict that just as numerous other proteins have evolved from generalists to specialists over many years of evolution, we can evolve Hsp104 from a generalist to a specialized molecular machine. We are also interested in testing the variants in various model systems including C. elegans, Drosophila, and motor neurons derived from reprogrammed patient fibroblasts. Protein misfolding is implicated in numerous other diseases. Thus we are interested in developing yeast models for these disorders and developing Hsp104 variants to counter the misfolding of these substrates. Finally, we are interested in using pure protein biochemistry and structural biology to better understand Hsp104 structure and mechanism. Amyloid is incredibly stable, thus we seek to understand how Hsp104 disassembles amyloid.

I lead a translational research laboratory aiming to improve cancer patient outcomes. A major component of my research program is to (1) develop strategies for improving the therapeutic ratio of radiation therapy by increasing tumor sensitivity to radiation and limiting normal tissue toxicity and (2) understand the biological mechanisms of treatment resistance. I have received NIH K22 funding to study the role of a biomarker in treatment resistance. I also have/had funding from the Lung Cancer Research Foundation and Elsa Pardee Foundation.The research projects that are currently being actively pursued in the lab include the following:
Project 1. Cancer-targeting antibody-drug conjugatesRadiation-sensitizing chemotherapy has shown promise in the clinic for cancer treatment. However, toxic side effects limit higher doses of systemically administered chemotherapy. In this project, radiation-sensitizing chemotherapy is delivered specifically to cancer using antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). We discovered a new cancer antigen that carries the ADCs specifically into cancer cells. Once the ADC is within the cell, the radiation-sensitizing drug is released and enhances the efficacy of therapy. Therefore, this approach delivers radiosensitizing drugs specifically to cancer each day compared to the current once-weekly administration of systemic chemotherapy. This new paradigm of guided delivery of the ADCs to tumors treated with radiation therapy will lead to clinical trials.
Project 2. Role of midkine in lung cancerNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ranks among the highest cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Molecular targeted therapy is a growing topic of investigation to improve therapeutic efficacy for NSCLC. A few targeted therapies that exploit aberrant protein expression profiles have been approved for NSCLC. However, the marginal percentage of cancers with improved efficacy observed with these therapeutic approaches highlights the need to discover additional molecular targets. We propose targeting the scaffold protein TIP1, a novel target for lung cancer as identified by analysis of the cancer genome atlas datasets and NSCLC tumor tissue microarrays. The functional domain of TIP1 (PDZ domain) caps the C-terminus of many different cellular proteins that regulate important cellular functions. Knocking down TIP1 revealed that it plays an essential role in cell signaling, cancer development, and progression, making it an attractive target for anticancer therapeutics. Comparing antibodies targeting different epitopes of TIP1, it was found that antibodies against the PDZ domain of TIP1 were most effective in inducing direct cytotoxicity of lung cancer cells but not normal cells. Anti-PDZ/TIP1 antibodies injected into mice bearing lung cancer bind specifically to cancer cells and substantially enhance tumor control. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified Midkine (MDK) as a putative protein that modulates this cytotoxicity by anti-PDZ/TIP1 antibodies. Additional studies suggested that the _-catenin/Wnt signaling may be involved in this up-regulation of MDK after blocking TIP1. Together, these studies led to the central hypothesis that the anti-PDZ/TIP1 antibody upregulates MDK via the _-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway, subsequently modulating downstream cell death mechanisms. In this project, we will elucidate the mechanisms of induction of MDK following the blockade of the PDZ domain of TIP1. In addition, we will evaluate the efficacy of blocking the TIP1 function while simultaneously blocking the MDK function in mouse models of NSCLC.
Project 3. Intercellular signaling by metalloproteases regulating cell viability and resistance to therapies.A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family of proteases induce ectodomain cleavage and shedding of cell surface proteins that regulate cell viability pathways. Overexpression of ADAM10 is correlated with poor survival in lung cancer patients. One of the signaling pathways regulated by ADAM proteases is Eph receptor/ligand complexes on the cell surface. We found cell surface interaction of ADAM10 and EphB3 with a cell surface chaperone protein, TIP1. TIP1 is a targetable cell surface protein that can deliver cytotoxic cancer therapies. Antibodies to the functional domain of TIP1 activate the endocytosis of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and the cytotoxic payload dissociates from the antibody following endocytosis. Blocking the functional domain of TIP1 activates ADAM10 and dephosphorylates EphB3. We hypothesize that TIP1 sheaths the proteolytic activity of ADAM10 on the cell surface, and blocking TIP1 function activates endocytosis via disruption of the Eph receptor pathway. This work will provide new insights into how TIP1 regulates ADAM10/Eph signaling. These studies will provide foundational knowledge toward our long-term goal of developing improved therapies for cancer treatment and an enhanced understanding of the fundamental processes of cancer progression.Ê

Most of these diseases are characterized by tau protein aggregation and are termed tauopathies. In these diseases, tau is affected at the molecular (splicing), protein (hyperphosphorylation, cleavage, aggregation), and cellular (secretion) levels. Thus, defining the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies require unraveling the complexities of the MAPT gene that encodes the tau protein, tau protein dysfunction within the cell, and the cell-cell interactions that produce pathology in the human brain. We use traditional immortalize and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron and astrocytes to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tauopathies.

Cytoskeleton dynamics plays an essential role in the shaping and trafficking of these different membrane structures, however cannot remodel membranes directly. In order to harness the power of the cytoskeleton for the purpose of membrane shaping, cells use diverse sets of modular proteins that form protein complexes with cytoskeleton and signaling proteins, which in turn can partition membranes into autonomous membrane micro-domains. My lab is focused on (1) understanding fundamental molecular mechanisms that govern intracellular membrane reorganization and protein sorting; (2) stimulating the development of fluorescence based assays to delineate important signaling pathways involved in the biogenesis and trafficking vesicle; (3) defining the role(s) of endocytic dysfunction in cancer and neurological disease and take advantage of endocytic pathways to deliver next generation therapeutics to diseased cells.

We start with quantifiable behavioral tasks, for both humans and rodents, that enable us to isolate and study distinct cognitive processes, such as decision confidence. We probe the neural basis of these processes in rodents using state-of-the-art electrophysiological, imaging, and optogenetic techniques to establish the underlying neural mechanisms. Given the complexity of behavior and the dynamics of neural networks producing it, we also develop new algorithms for analyzing data and models to help us interpret them. By understanding how brains accomplish cognitive tasks, often beyond the capacity of current machine learning algorithms, we also expect to uncover new computational principles. In terms of topics our approach is multifaceted, currently we study the neural basis of decision confidence, impulsivity, social value and foraging; the division of labor among cell-types in prefrontal cortex; communication across cortical regions; neuromodulatory systems and most recently brain-body interactions. By identifying the neural processes underlying specific behavioral capacities in rodent models of cognition, we also seek insights into what goes awry in the brain during mental illness to build a bridge from animal studies to psychiatry. Ultimately, we hope these insights will lead to develop novel therapeutic strategies for psychiatric disorders such as addiction, major depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder."

Yet, due to inaccessibility of most central synapses to conventional experimental techniques, many basic synaptic mechanisms and their computational significance remain elusive. Research in my laboratory is focused on understanding the mechanisms and regulation of neurotransmitter release in central synapses in healthy and disease conditions. Our second major interest is elucidating the functional roles of presynaptic processes in synaptic plasticity and information processing. We are currently developing three main projects to address these questions by:1. Studying presynaptic release mechanisms and synaptic vesicle cycling at the level of individual synapses. Using super-resolution imaging techniques in combination with advanced image analysis and computational approaches we can simultaneously visualize movements and release of several vesicles inside a synapse. In parallel, we use high-resolution capacitance measurements to detect and study fusion of individual synaptic vesicles at active zones.2. Investigating how presynaptic processes give rise to short-term plasticity and how this plasticity determines information processing by individual synapses and functional circuits. Using natural spike trains recorded in behaving rodents we extend this analysis from individual synapses to the circuit level, and investigate synaptic interactions in basic feed-forward and feed-back circuits.3. Relating deregulation in synaptic mechanisms with the impairment of information processing observed in many developmental diseases, such as Fragile X syndrome. We use mouse model of Fragile X syndrome and a variety of imaging, electrophysiological, biochemical and behavioral approaches to analyze how synaptic function and plasticity in cortical and hippocampal neurons is affected in this disorder.

Biogenesis of extracellular components. Our group studies the assembly of cytochrome c in photosynthetic bacteria and pathogens such as Bordetella. We have isolated bacterial mutants and genes involved in this assembly process, which occurs outside the cytoplasmic membrane. The model we have developed for this process includes an ATP-dependent heme export system homologous to membrane translocators like the cystic fibrosis protein. Other components that are predicted to function as periplasmic heme and apocytochrome chaperones and thiol reduction proteins are under investigation. General processes that occur in all organisms for which these studies are relevant include mechanisms of heme and iron transport, disulfide bond formation and reduction, and protein folding and secretion.
Gene regulatory studies. Photosynthetic microorganisms possess the ability to adapt metabolically to a wide range of growth conditions in nature. This capacity to convert from one mode to another is facilitated by complex regulatory systems that respond to changes in their environment. Our research is directed toward understanding these capabilities of photosynthetic bacteria, with particular emphasis on the genes for nitrogen and photosynthetic control. We have obtained mutants in and have cloned regulatory genes, both negative and positive activators, that respond to oxygen and nitrogen availability. The regulatory cascades along with the transcriptional machinery have been reconstituted in vitro for detailed studies.

Currently, over 7 million people in the United States suffer from the long-term effects of stroke and is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Recovery from stroke requires plasticity to allow remapping, or Òrewiring,Ó of disrupted neuronal circuits. Such mechanisms are influenced by sleep, which is an ideal target for therapeutic intervention due to its well-studied role in mediating plasticity. Our lab studies the connection between plasticity-dependent mechanisms for stroke recovery and sleep-dependent plasticity.

These unfortunate results underscore the need for an improved understanding of how the heart responds to injury, identification of novel drug targets and further development of such therapies.

Questions such as: Are particular metabolic traits more genetically or epigenetically controlled? How does diet affect the relative contribution of genetics or epigenetics? Do differences in genetic and epigenetic modes of regulation result in discordance among metabolic traits? Answers to these questions are critical to understanding why some individuals with metabolic complications respond to lifestyle modifications while others require therapeutic interventions. Further, understanding how diet modifies genetic and epigenetic effects might shed light on why some obese individuals develop metabolic complications while others remain metabolically normal. We have found prevalent complex parent-of-origin effects on dietary obesity-related metabolic traits. However, there is currently no way to predict these epigenetic effects on phenotype from DNA sequence. The ability to predict such effects would be a step towards personalized medicine and towards understanding how associations among metabolic traits evolved. We integrate whole-genome sequence data with phenotypic data to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture of metabolic traits. We work with mouse models, which allow experimental manipulations of genotype and environmental factors under controlled conditions. Our research aims to: 1) learn under what context(s) parent-of-origin influences phenotype; 2) understand how diet affects relationships among obesity-related traits; and 3) translate results found in our discovery research to human datasets.

DNMT3A, which encodes one of the two de novo DNA methyltransferases, is one of the most common AML-initiating mutations, occurring in a third of patients with normal karyotype disease. DNMT3A mutations are the most common cause of clonal expansion of blood cell progenitors in the elderly (ÒClonal HematopoiesisÓ), a condition that greatly increases the risk of developing AML. Loss of DNMT3A function leads to the development of thousands of hypomethylated regions in the genomes of hematopoietic cells, but only subtle effects on gene expression.

We are particularly interested in how the multifunctional organelles called peroxisomes channel lipids to discrete subcellular compartments to influence metabolism. Peroxisomes are closely associated with lipid droplets and mitochondria. Their ability to carry out fatty acid oxidation and lipid synthesis, especially the production of ether-linked phospholipids, may be critical for generating cellular signals required for normal physiology. We have developed several new mouse models to study various aspects of peroxisome biology, including peroxisomal biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ether lipid synthesis. We are interested in the physiological roles of these processes in various metabolic organs, such as adipose tissue, pancreatic islets, liver, and skeletal muscle. The major focus is on the role of peroxisomes in adipose tissue.

"Majumdar, Susruta"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Neurosciences			"Our goal is to understand molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of opioid action integrating chemical synthesis with biochemical, genetic and pharmacological approaches. Our eventual goal is to discover novel chemical probes/drugs, which can be useful in the treatment of pain and substance abuse, and which separate the opioid agonist mediated liabilities from its utility in medications development. Opiates such as morphine have been the preferred treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain. Clinically used mu opiate agonists/ analgesics (MOR) like morphine are associated with severe adverse-effects such as respiratory depression, constipation, physical dependence, reward, addiction and abuse liability. To overcome these problems, drugs in the kappa category were developed; however, kappa opioid agonists/ analgesics (KOR) had additional problems such as aversion, dysphoria and hallucinations. Delta opioid agonists (DOR) have been investigated as well, but the role of small molecule delta agonists has been limited due to the implication of these drugs in causing seizures. Thus, there remains a need for opioid drug targets/molecules, which will provide pain relief without side-effects.ÊWork from the laboratory has led to probes which display G-protein biased signaling, truncated transmembrane splice variants of mu opioid receptor agonists and aided the crystallization of kappa opioid receptor in its active form and cryo-EM structures of natural product bound mu opioid modulators. Presently we use two distinct strategies to achieve opioid functional selectivity using natural products pharmacology, targeting allosteric sub pockets in receptors and identifying the molecular blueprint of arrestin recruitment using structure based approaches.Ê

At the moment, our research focuses on two specific goals using the data from the DIAN (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer`s Network) project, which has already been collected, and is a well-characterized cohort. The age of onset of AD in this cohort is very close to that of their relatives (within a couple of years). Among the imaging markers that have been measured are the amount and distribution of Amyloid in the brain (amyloid plaques are a signature of AD); the distribution of glucose metabolism (measured using FDG (uorodeoxyglucose) as an imaging ligand), which shows how active different areas of the brain are; the volume of different brain regions (some shrink as the brain atrophies with AD); and the interconnectivity of the resting state (in a healthy brain, different regions` neural activity are correlated; as AD develops, this correlation breaks down).
Goal 1: How are these 4 imaging markers (Amyloid, glucose metabolism, volume, and resting state) related? What is the relationship between their topographies?
Goal 2: Using multivariate measurements, can we improve the prediction of time to onset? Is one set of measurements sufficient, or does longitudinal data improve the prediction?

One major focus of the lab is the investigation of Fat cadherins.  Fat cadherins are enormous cell adhesion molecules that regulates cell proliferation, metabolism and cell polarity in all metazoa. We use Drosophila as a genetically tractable organism to investigate the basic and conserved mechanisms of Fat function and the control of Hippo pathway activity, and then extend our work to mammalian systems.  Our most recent work has uncovered a novel and exciting role for Fat cadherins in regeneration.We found that binding of Fat to its ligand Ds promotes Fat phosphorylation and signaling to the Hippo pathway. Now we are using proteomic screening to identify Fat cadherin pathway effectors, using BioID to identify interaction partners in a near physiological context. We also found that Ft cadherins undergo sequential cleavages release a cytosolic fragment that is imported into mitochondria (Fat-mito), where it binds Ndufv2, a component of CI.Our work on Fat and the Hippo pathway in mouse models has revealed a critical and unsuspected role for the Hippo growth control pathway in morphogenesis. Using whole animal conditional and organ-culture approaches, we found that loss of NF2 or LATS or overexpression of YAP leads to growth and elongation of the collecting ducts in the absence of branching morphogenesis. To understand better how branching is affected, we will conduct high-resolution time-lapse imaging of the induction of branching morphogenesis. We will also assay tissue tension at junctions in the developing kidney with laser ablation and reporter assays.In addition to our studies on Fat and the Hippo pathway, a new area of exciting research in the lab focuses on a novel nuclear membrane protein we isolated in genetic screens that we have found is essential for chromatin structure and fertility in flies, mice and fish.  This project is taking us into exploring how changes in the nuclear envelope impact gene expression and cell fate.

"McPherson, Jacob"	Neurosciences				"Dr. McPhersonÕs research is focused on interrelationships between the neural control of movement and pain processing after spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke. His work is rooted in the tight co-regulation of neural transmission in spinal motor and pain pathways and is motivated by the reality that for many individuals living with neurological injury, daily life is a balancing act between movement and pain. The ultimate goal of his work is to develop therapeutic strategies that leverage the interconnectivity of spinal motor and sensory networks to drive multi-modal rehabilitation."

In my lab, we use person-specific and group analyses to determine how pathologic motor commands correspond with movement impairments. We do this using neural and biomechanical measures of motor output as well as the development of technologies that will enable the neurorehabilitation field to address scientific questions that were previously intractable due to methodological and computational barriers.  We use our results to inform the development of rehabilitation interventions that are rooted in nervous system neuropathophysiology."
"Meacham, John"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"				"My research vision is to realize new technologies and methods that enable investigation of otherwise inaccessible physical, chemical and biological processes. Introduction of micro- and nanotechnology concepts, as well as creative integration and coupling strategies, is critical to development of instruments and methods for control, observation and measurement of natural phenomena that occur at such scales. Micro- and nanoscale processes form a central theme of my professional training, connecting research thrusts in biology, medicine, thermal, fluidic and energetic systems, and micro-/nanofabrication. Research in the Scalable Integrated MicroSystems (SIMS) laboratory at Washington University (WU) synthesizes knowledge of microfluidics and microfabrication to establish new methods for intracellular delivery/transfection, to create acoustic cages for interrogation of microorganisms, to facilitate microfluidic chemical synthesis, to simulate the natural environment of cells and tissues, and to investigate interfacial phenomena that occur during multiphase and particulate flows.
Micro- and nanotechnologies are ideally-suited to manipulation and investigation of biological processes occurring at all scales (from sub-_m biomolecules and organelles to 1Ð10s of _m cells to mm-scale tissues) due to the dimensional similarity of target objects and typical micro-/nanostructures. Prior to WU, my work at OpenCell Technologies (an early stage biotech company that I co-founded) proved that application of biophysical actions on smaller-and-smaller scales enhances intracellular nanomaterial delivery. Since joining the faculty of WU, I have greatly expanded upon this theme to develop microfluidic solutions for manipulation and measurement of biomolecules, bacteria and motile microorganisms, among other cell types. Some technologies extend the applicability of an approach (on-chip antibody-construct synthesis), while others enable investigations that were not previously possible (acoustic caging of flagellated algae). Below, I briefly describe independent and collaborative projects in my current research program, which are focused on biological systems and human health."

One branch of this project is studying the role of astrocytes in neuroenergetics.  Another major emphasis is a collaborative effort to understand the mechanisms by which endogenous neuroactive steroids directly modulate GABA and glutamate receptor function. A final project uses a foreign dopamine-gated ion channel to interrogate and control dopamine transmission.

With our many collaborators, we have pioneered genomic analysis of small RNAs and their targets, working with ""next-gen"" sequencing technologies nearly since their invention. Our early work with next-gen sequencing led to the development of informatics and analysis tools that we used to characterize small RNA pathways in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and other plants. The lab continued to develop mRNA and small RNA analyses using different types of next-gen sequencing and techniques. The Meyers lab has widely applied these methods to study diverse plant genomes and their RNA products. Specific areas of research include microRNAs, heterochromatic siRNAs and the connection to DNA methylation, microRNA targets, non-coding RNAs, and gene silencing. A current emphasis of our work is phased, secondary siRNAs in plants (aka ""phasiRNAs""), including their roles in post-transcriptional control of diverse protein-coding genes, and in reproductive biology, mainly in anthers. Originally characterized in grasses, there are two classes of phasiRNAs are transiently abundant during anther development, at the premeiotic and meiotic stages; we have shown these emerged coincident with flowering plants and were lost in some lineages. The roles of these small RNAs are poorly characterized, and many of our current experiments focus on these molecules.
We also continue to study disease resistance genes in plants, name the NLR or ""NB-LRR"" genes that provide the first line of defense in many specific plant-pathogen interactions. These genes are targets of an unusually diverse set of microRNAs, triggering phasiRNAs, and providing an excellent case study for post-transcriptional control and its evolution in plants.

"Miller, Mark"	Immunology	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis			"My group is using multi-photon microscopy (MPM) in combination with histological and genetic approaches to study the immune response to bacterial infection in the spleen. The spleen plays a crucial role in host defense by trapping and destroying blood-borne pathogens and triggering the adaptive immune response. However, few details are known regarding how early host-pathogen interactions lead to antigen presentation and immunity. Preliminary results from my lab indicate that bacterial challenge in mice induces the rapid redistribution of splenic macrophages and dendritic cells in a bacteria-specific fashion. Our hypothesis is that tissue remodeling serves an Òantigen transportÓ function that delivers pathogen-derived antigens to distinct microenvironments for presentation. Because both the antigen presenting cell type and the local environment impact the immune response, this could provide a mechanism to tailor immune responses to a wide-range of pathogens. We are focusing our investigations on three key stages of infection: 1) the initial capture and fate of bacteria in marginal zone macrophages and dendritic cells, 2) the migration of these cells in response to infection, and 3) bacterial-antigen presentation in tissue microenvironments and its influence on the subsequent adaptive immune response. Moreover, the multi-dimensional cell tracking data from these studies is being used to create in silico models of infection and immunity in the hope of providing fresh mechanistic insight into microbial pathogenesis and guide vaccine development.

In order to address this problem, we have been developing new tools for constructing peptide mimics that allow for the rapid insertion of conformational constraints into pre-selected sites within a peptide. This chemistry capitalizes on the use of electroauxiliaries that allow for the selective oxidation of a single nitrogen within the peptide backbone. The oxidation reactions can be conducted using either anodic electrochemistry or chemical oxidants. Once the constrained peptide mimics are constructed, they are used to ÒmapÓ the conformational requirements of peptide receptors for which there is limited structural data available.
Oxidative Cyclization Reactions. The formation of new carbon-carbon bonds and the generation of new ring compounds lies at the heart of synthetic organic chemistry. New reactions that can generate the cyclic framework that provides the three-dimensional structure of a molecule can change not only particular steps within a synthesis but also the entire synthetic route being examined. Recently, we discovered that anodic electrochemistry could be used to efficiently generate and study highly reactive radical cation intermediates. The radical cation intermediates were used to initiate a variety of new cyclization reactions that accomplished the net coupling of two electron-rich nucleophiles. These reactions are currently being used to construct a variety of biologically interesting natural products.

"Moran, Daniel"	Neurosciences				"My primary research interest is in the area of voluntary motor control. My lab investigates how various neural substrates control voluntary movement. Specifically, I am interested in cortical representation of arm movements. Our recent findings show that individual cells in the primary motor cortex encode both the direction and speed of an impending movement. Combining the activity of a number (~100) of these motor cortical cells, a high-fidelity prediction of hand velocity is observed approximately a tenth of a second before it is performed by the limb. This information has been utilized by several research groups for both open-loop, real-time kinematic control of robotic arms as well as closed-loop control of a virtual reality environment.
Motor learning and neural plasticity is another research area in which I am very interested. All the motor cortical studies to date have used over-trained subjects during their recordings in order to average data over many recording sessions. However, with recent advances in multi, single-unit chronic recording methods, a naive subject can be recorded over a period of months to investigate what role various areas of cerebral cortex play in motor learning. How motor cortical activity changes over multiple motor learning sessions is invaluable data for designing motor cortical controlled neuroprostheses.
Future research projects will involve controlling complex 3D musculoskeletal models with cortical signals. This research will initially utilize real-time cortical recordings in non-human primates in a virtual reality environment. However, instead of controlling arm kinematics directly, the cortical signal would be applied through optimization routines which will determine individual muscle activation levels. These levels would then be fed through the musculoskeletal model of the arm with the resulting kinematics displayed by the virtual arm. When successful, the subjects arm could be deenervated and implanted with stimulators for experimental testing of FNS restoration of voluntary arm movement by a cortical implant.

In addition, given the fact that opiates are widely used in the clinic for the treatment of acute and chronic pain conditions, and the current rise in the rates of addiction to, and misuse of prescription opiates, we are interested in examining the effects of the presence of chronic pain on opiate intake and in the motivation for opiate self-administration. Additional studies will also be conducted in order to determine the effects of chronic pain on neural circuits within the reward pathway. Finally, it has been reported that opioid receptors (mu, delta, kappa) can form heterodimers following chronic opiate administration. The formation of these receptor heteromers has been reported to be involved in the mechanisms underlying opiate tolerance. Therefore, in an additional project we will examine whether the formation of a mu-delta opioid receptor heteromer is responsible for the expression of observed analgesic tolerance upon chronic opiate administration with the overall goal to develop novel drugs to enhance the analgesic properties of the opiate without side effects (i.e. tolerance).

Current strategies aim to engineer cell fate by means of directed differentiation from a pluripotent state or by transcription factor-driven conversion between differentiated states. Directed differentiation protocols typically involve multiple steps, can be laborious, and commonly yield immature cells corresponding to embryonic stages of development rather than fully mature adult cells. In contrast, direct conversion is relatively straightforward and rapid but there is evidence for incomplete conversion, especially between divergent cell types.Using a network biology approach, we recently found that cells generated by direct conversion do not faithfully recapitulate the target cell type. Original cell identity was not extinguished and the converted cells did not resemble fully mature cell types. Employing induced hepatocytes (iHeps) generated from fibroblasts as a prototypical conversion, our computational and functional analyses showed that iHeps behave as embryonic progenitors with the potential to functionally engraft both the liver and colon. We found that these engineered cells resembled mature colonic epithelium only after  transplantation into the colon niche.Our research focuses on the study of gene regulatory networks to dissect and engineer cell fate of clinically relevant tissues such as the liver. First, we aim to understand how transcription factor overexpression drives changes in the transcriptional program to remodel cell identity, and how we can exploit this to derive desired cell types. Second, we transplant engineered cells into the in vivo niche, tracking their maturation in order to understand the steps required to fully differentiate cells in vitro. Finally, we employ single cell transcriptomics to understand how cell fate is specified in the developing embryo, formulating a blueprint of cell identity to help engineer fate in vitro. Ultimately, we wish to  translate new insights in cell fate specification into better human models of liver disease and eventually into the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Efforts in systems and synthetic cell biology have focused mainly on the design principles of gene expression and signaling systems. A quantitative understanding of eukaryotic cellular organization in space, however, would afford biophysicists and bioengineers with a powerful opportunity to predict how the physical architecture of the cell constrains and regulates fundamental life processes. To unleash this potential, it is imperative to understand one of the defining features of the eukaryotic cell: its organization into spatial compartments known as organelles. Coordinating organelle abundance and activity with developmental and environmental cues is one of the chief ways the cell can match its biochemical capabilities with its physiological demands. How does the cell orchestrate flows of matter and energy to produce exquisitely defined organelles at the nanometer and femtoliter scales of a cell? Can we engineer the decision-making processes in the cell to control organelle copy number, size, and composition in vivo and can this allow us to rationally alter cellular metabolism and signaling toward desired goals?
In our group, we aim to use a combination of theory and experiment to uncover the design principles that control:

Our laboratory is interested in understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling the development of cell lineages within both arms of the immune response. Specifically, current projects include the development of dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils from common precursors, the transcriptional basis for T helper subset differentiation, and the identification of novel receptors and signaling molecules involved in regulating dendritic cell function.

I study patterns and causes of biodiversity at multiple scales, ranging from variation in the diversity of speciesÕ traits to gradients in the assembly, diversity and dynamics of ecological communities across the planet. I explore theories to explain why changes in biodiversity through space and time emerge via the interplay of fundamental processes of community assembly (dispersal, ecological drift, niche selection & speciation). My research group focuses on four questions that integrate concepts from community ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology, and plant functional ecology:Ê
¥ Community Assembly from Local to Global Scales: What processes determine community assembly across biodiversity gradients?
¥ Eco-Evolutionary Assembly of Biodiversity Hotspots: How do species-rich communities and regional biotas assemble?
¥ Biodiversity in Changing Environments: Why does environmental change alter biodiversity, biotic interactions, and ecological networks?
¥ Species Pools, Species Traits & Biodiversity Change: How does regional biodiversity assemble into local communities in natural and human-modified landscapes?
We explore these questions using field experiments, large-scale and long-term observations, ecological modeling, and synthesis of biodiversity data from plant communities spanning temperate to tropical regions and natural to human-modified ecosystems. Our current study ecosystems include temperate plant and pollinator communities in North America (e.g., the Ozarks & Northern Rockies), sub-tropical savannas within the hyperdiverse and threatened longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern United States (e.g., Florida & Louisiana), tropical forests from the Amazon to the Andes (e.g., Bolivia), and a worldwide network of temperate and tropical forest-dynamics plots coordinated through the Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory (CTFS-ForestGEO).

In addition, the complex bone matrix may serve as a growth factor repository and thereby operate to influence haematopoietic events and contribute to the regenerative properties of bone. Bone modeling during development and remodeling throughout life are dependent upon factors that regulate the number and activity of both bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing multinucleated osteoclasts. Deciphering the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that govern bone cell precursor recruitment, differentiation and activity is, therefore, important for understanding both normal and pathological processes in bone.

ÊThe goal of our laboratory is to close this knowledge gap and define the cellular origins and molecular mechanisms of germ cell regeneration. What are the embryonic origins of cells involved in reproductive cell regeneration? Can any cell type regenerate reproductive cells, or are there limitations to which cells can replace them? ÊHow is the genome integrity maintained in regenerated reproductive cells?

"Pachynski, Russell"	Cancer Biology	Immunology	Molecular Cell Biology		"My lab studies leukocyte trafficking in the setting of the immune response to tumor development, growth, and treatment. Our focus is on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved in these settings. We utilize mouse tumor models to understand these interactions, and manipulate chemokine/chemokine receptor axes in order to favorably alter the leukocyte profile in the tumor microenvironment. We are investigating a number of different chemokines, but have worked extensively with a novel chemoattractant, chemerin, that we have found is downregulated in a majority of tumors. Forced re-expression of chemerin within the tumor results in reduced tumor growth and increased leukocyte infiltrate. We are working on a number of approaches to translate such findings into clinical use, such as nanoparticles, viral delivery, and novel fusion proteins. Clinically, my focus is on genitourinary immunotherapy, and we have a number of projects related to this. We are actively pursuing novel combinations of immunotherapeutics to test in humans, and plan to do in depth immune monitoring on these patients."
"Padoa-Schioppa, Camillo"	Neurosciences				"Economic choice takes place when individuals make choices solely based on subjective preferencesÑfor example out of a restaurant menu. Choice behavior is a traditional focus in economics and psychology, and a large body of work shows that human choices suffer from various ÒfallaciesÓ. Economic choice is also important from a medical perspective, as choice deficits are often observed in patients with neurological disorders of the frontal lobe and in addiction. Research in my laboratory investigates the cognitive and neuronal mechanisms underlying economic choice. We combine behavioral, neurophysiological and computational techniques, focusing in particular on single-cell recordings in non-human primates.Behavioral evidence indicates that economic choice entails assigning values to the available optionsÑfor example, to different items on the menu. Thus a fundamental question is how values are represented in the brain. In recent years, we found that individual neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the value monkeys assign to different juices when they choose between them. Neurons in the OFC encode the subjective value, as opposed to any physical property of the juice. The representation of value in this area is rather abstract. The activity of OFC neurons does not depend on the visuo-motor contingencies of choice, and it is invariant for changes of menu. In other words, the activity encoding the value of one particular good does not depend on what other goods are available at the same time. Such menu invariance may underlie preference transitivity, a fundamental trait of economic choice.In our current work, we seek to address some fundamental and open questions. How does the representation of value in the OFC adapt to different behavioral contexts? Are values also represented in other brain areas, and how do neurons in OFC and other brain regions generate a decision? Can choice fallacies and choice deficits observed in frontal patients and drug addicts be explained by the neurobiology of these neuronal populations?

The approximately ten million billion mitochondria throughout our bodies produce the bulk of our chemical energy in the form of ATP and are the cellular home to a vast array of essential metabolic pathways and processes.Dysfunction of these organelles underlies hundreds of inborn errors of metabolism and strongly contributes to a growing list of common metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, including type II diabetes, ParkinsonÕs disease, AlzheimerÕs disease, and various forms of cancer.
Despite this central role for mitochondria in human health and disease, much of the basic biology of these organelles remains obscure, and therapeutic options to treat mitochondrial dysfunction remain woefully inadequate. By blending classic biochemistry, molecular & cellular biology, and genetics with large-scale proteomics and systems approaches, our lab aims to systematically define the functions of uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins, identify new gene mutations that underlie human disease, and explore new molecular therapeutics to rectify mitochondria-based disorders.

The current focus is on the mechanisms of aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine tracts. This is directly relevant to HuntingtonÕs disease and eight other neurodegenerative disorders. Recent efforts have focused on the cis-regulation of polyglutamine aggregation by flanking sequences derived from huntingtin and the interplay between aggregation and heterotypic interactions as determinants of neurodegeneration.ÊInvestigations of sequence-to-ensemble relationships of IDPs are being leveraged to understand how conformational heterogeneity is used to achieve specificity in molecular recognition.

"Pham, Christine"	Immunology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics			"The focus of our laboratory is to define the role of proteases in immunity and autoimmunity. Traditionally, proteases are viewed as effector molecules owing to their ability to digest extracellular matrix (ECM). More recently, studies have extended the role of proteases beyond the degradation of ECM. For example, we have generated a mouse deficient in cathepsin C (or dipeptidyl peptidase I, DPPI) and established that this protease is crucial in the activation of many serine proteases including lymphocyte-associated granzymes, mast cell-derived chymase, and neutrophil-specific cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3. We have further shown that DPPI and the serine proteases it activates are key molecules involved in cell-mediated cytotoxicity and leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation. The absence of DPPI rendered mice resistant to experimentally induced arthritis and death in a model of sepsis. Therefore, a more complete understanding of the functional physiology of proteases should lead to a better understanding of immune effector cell biology and may potential lead to novel therapeutic interventions."

"Pike, Linda"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology			"The EGF receptor is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase. Stimulation of cells with EGF leads to increases in metabolic activity and ultimately in cell proliferation. The EGF receptor and its homologous ErbB family members are over-expressed in many human tumors and several clinically useful drugs are directed against these proteins. My laboratory is interested in the the regulation of cell signaling via the EGF receptor and ErbB family members. We are particularly interested in the early steps that follow the binding of ligand and in understanding how the structure of the receptor enables transduction of the ligand binding signal through the membrane.In the membrane, the EGF receptor is thought to exist as a dimer, but upon binding ligand, the receptor dimerizes and its tyrosine kinase is activated. Using ligand binding analyses, we have shown that the EGF receptor exhibits negative cooperativity between binding sites in the active dimer and we are currently doing a mutational analysis to define the structural aspects of the EGF receptor that underlie this allosteric phenomenon. More recently, we have uncovered evidence for higher order oligomerization of the receptor, that appears to be susceptible to alteration by therapeutic inhibitors of the EGF receptor kinase.  We are investigating how these higher order oligomers modulate EGF receptor-mediated signaling and how this effects the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapies.We previously developed a split luciferase enzyme complementation system that allows us to image EGF receptor dimerization in real time in live cells. We have now extended this system to allow us to measure the association of the EGF receptor with important downstream signaling molecules to allow us to understand how the binding of these proteins to the receptor affects the signaling capacity of the receptor.  We have characterized the binding of eight different downstream signaling proteins to the EGF receptor stimulated by seven different EGF receptor ligands.  Currently, we are using principal component analysis, clustering and network analysis to identify differences among the growth factors in the way they stimulate different pathways in the network.X-ray crystallographic structures exist for both the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor and the intracellular kinase domain.  However, the structure of the C-terminal tail, to which all the signaling proteins bind, is unknown.  The reason for this is that this ~200 amino acid segment is intrinsically disordered.  Using FPOP footprinting and MD simulations, we are attempting to generate structural models that will tell us how the different proteins bind to the EGF receptor tail and how many might be able to bind to a single receptor.  We are also doing a mutational analysis of the tail to determine whether it is just the intrinsic disorder that is important for the signaling function of the tale or whether there are auxiliary sequences that contribute to the regulation of protein-protein interactions.

These new tools are revolutionizing almost all fields of biomedical research, and we continue to optimize such methods and expand the scope of their applicability. In our lab, research questions are focused on a model multicellular system, the islet of Langerhans, which is the functional unit responsible for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and glucose inhibition of glucagon secretion. The islet contains glucagon secreting Alpha-cells, insulin-secreting Beta-cells, and somatostatin-secreting Delta-cells, among others. The long-term goal of our work is to understand at a quantitative molecular level the subcellular, cellular, and multicellular mechanisms of islet function, and its role in the regulation of blood glucose under normal and pathological conditions. Rotation projects are available in all the labÕs research areas. The therapeutic success of insulin has led most islet research to focus on Beta-cells, although recent findings have strengthened our understanding of glucagonÕs critical role in glucose homeostasis and the pathology of diabetes. Interactions with other islet cell types are thought to be involved in glucose-inhibition of glucagon secretion, since this inhibition is lost in vivo during Type 1 and advanced Type 2 diabetes, and in vitro when Beta-cells are isolated from the islet. While many compounds have been shown to inhibit glucagon secretion from islets, no consensus model has been reached. The secretory product of Delta-cells, somatostatin, is a promising molecular mediator of this interaction, but somatostatin alone does not inhibit glucagon secretion from isolated Alpha-cells. This suggests that other cell-cell interactions within the islet are required to combine with somatostatin for proper function.

The Ponder Lab produces and distributes software packages ranging from macromolecular mechanics and dynamics simulation (TINKER) to molecular visualization (Force Field Explorer) to empirical packing analysis of protein structure (PROPAK) to sequence analysis and tertiary structure prediction (SLEUTH). Our current research focuses on two main areas related to biopolymer modeling. First, we have implemented efficient methods for including multipole electrostatics and polarization in simulations as a framework for our next-generation AMOEBA force field. This new energy model enables reliable calculation of structures and has significant advantages over traditional fixed partial atomic charge models such as Amber and CHARMM. It also yields energetics for ligand docking and drug design to within ""chemical accuracy""--absolute errors of 0.5 kcal/mol or less. Current AMOEBA applications include free energy calculations of binding interactions, elucidation of the role of ions in biology, and refinement of highly accurate homology models. Second, we are exploring various powerful approaches to conformational search for flexible biopolymers. One method transforms the potential energy surface for a molecule by a diffusion equation-based smoothing procedure. This ""potential smoothing"" paradigm is applicable to a variety of problems including transmembrane helix packing, global optimization, and energy-based clustering of conformations. Another search method is based on a novel distance geometry algorithm and heuristic rules as a basis for protein structure prediction. Statistical distance distributions and predicted secondary structure constraints generate libraries of candidate folds to be scored with an informatics-based contact function or physics-based effective mean force potential. Ultimately, our interest in conformational search lies in the ""end game"" of protein folding--in making a connection between atomic-level protein structures and low-resolution models available from fold recognition algorithms.

"Randolph, Gwendalyn"	Immunology	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"By focusing on the trafficking of molecules and cells out of tissues, my research laboratory integrates immunology and vascular biology with the study of disease mechanisms linked to inflammation. In parallel to the study of disease mechanisms, we carry out basic science essential to the interpretation of observations in the disease context. Early in my career, I worked on the fate of monocytes as they differentiated to macrophages or dendritic cells, with a particular interest in the development of their ability to traffic out of inflammatory tissues via lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes, as we considered the role of such trafficking in the ability of an inflammatory state to resolve. Over time, in interacting with scientists bringing diverse expertise to atherosclerosis, where I worked on monocyte trafficking for several years, my laboratory developed an interest in the trafficking of not just cells but also of molecules, particularly lipoproteins out of tissues, since the inability of lipoproteins to reach key sites or to become trapped can affect the course of inflammation. We developed approaches to examine trafficking of lipoproteins through tissue interstitial spaces, asking (as we had done for immune cells) how reliant on functional lymphatics was a lipoprotein's ability to leave tissues appropriately to promote key processes like reverse cholesterol transport. In recent years, we realized that the tri-partite expertise we developed (immune cell trafficking, lipoprotein trafficking, lymphatic vessel biology) could be put to work on new questions in disease states less well understood than atherosclerosis. One such question is whether lymphatics that carry lipid nutrients, immune cells, and other cargo away from the gut become dysfunctional in inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease. We have thus transitioned our research to understanding the trafficking of cellular and molecular cargo out of the intestine to downstream tissues and organs like lymph nodes and liver. The lymphatic vasculature draining the intestine traverses the mesenteric adipose tissue within the peritoneal cavity. We also specialize in the immune cell (especially macrophage) microenvironment of the peritoneal cavity and the impact of its physiology on neighboring organs and intraperitoneal perturbations like inflammation and peritoneal tumor metastasis.

Our studies of HTLV-1 are concerned with analysis of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis through studies of: transforming determinants in an infectious immortalizing HTLV-1 proviral clone; transgenic models utilizing the HTLV-1 trans-activator protein, which results in a lymphoproliferative malignancy; and identification and characterization of the receptor for the virus.

"Ravichandran, Kodi"	Immunology	Molecular Cell Biology			"Engulfment of apoptotic cells - the art of eating a good meal
Every day, we turn over billions of cells as part of normal development and homeostasis. Majority of these cells die by via caspase-dependent apoptosis. The recognition and phagocytic removal of these apoptotic cells occurs via the process of ÔefferocytosisÕ and is fundamentally important for our health. Failure to promptly and efficiently clear apoptotic cells can lead to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity and developmental defects. Efferocytosis is usually done by neighboring cells or by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells, although many non-professional phagocytes such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts can function as efferocytes in different tissues in vivo.
In studying efferocytosis, we consider four broad issues related to Ôeating an apoptotic mealÕ. The first issue is getting to the meal itself. This involves the release of so called Ôfind-me signalsÕ from apoptotic cells that serve as attraction cues to recruit monocytes and macrophages near an apoptotic cell. Besides the phagocyte recruitment function, we have also identified a critical role for metabolites released from apoptotic cells as Ôgood-bye signalsÕ that impact the tissue in multiple ways. In this context, we focus on Pannexin channels, which are ÔopenedÕ during apoptosis by caspase-mediated cleavage. Pannexins are one of the key conduits for release of metabolites from apoptotic cells. Pannexin channels can also play roles in live cells, for example in communication between Teff and Treg cells.
The second issue is determining what is on the menu, and distinguishing the apoptotic cell from the neighboring healthy cells. This is achieved through expression of Ôeat-meÕ signals on apoptotic cells and their recognition by receptors on phagocytes. Here, we focus on the ligands on the dying cell and receptors on phagocytes that are involved in the specific recognition of apoptotic cells. Our work has identified a novel role for the adhesion type GPCR BAI1 as a receptor for phosphatidylserine, a key eat-me signal exposed on apoptotic cells. Ê
The third issue we study is the act of eating the meal itself. Here, we focus on the specific intracellular signals that are initiated within the phagocyte when it comes in contact with apoptotic cells, and how this leads to cytoskeletal rearrangements of the phagocyte and internalization of the target (imagine swallowing a neighbor nearly your own size!). We have extensively studied a signaling pathway downstream of BAI1 involving the proteins ELMO1, Dock180 and the small GTPase Rac in membrane reorganization. We have generated transgenic and knockout mice targeting various engulfment molecules. Our recent work has highlighted the induction of a solute carrier proteins (SLCs) program in phagocytes and how SLCs control the appetite of a phagocyte. Ê
The fourth topic relates to Ôafter-the-mealÕ issues. Contrary to other types of phagocytosis (such as bacterial uptake), engulfment of apoptotic cells is actively anti-inflammatory. We are interested in determining how apoptotic cells induce an anti-inflammatory state of the phagocyte, and how this relates to immune tolerance. Ê
Another fun problem when one cell eats another cell is that the phagocyte essentially doubles its cellular contents (including protein, cholesterol, nucleotides etc. - think of a neighbor moving into your house!). We are addressing how the ingested cargo is processed within the phagocyte, and how the phagocyte manages homeostasis and continue to ingest multiple corpses in succession. Phagocytes do not function alone, and in tissues they are next to other phagocytes and other cells; thus, we also focus on how efferocytic phagocytes communicate with each other and other cells. Given how many auto-inflammatory diseases are now linked to failed or defective efferocytosis, we are interested in how we can boost efferocytosis in vivo. We study disease models of lung inflammation, arthritis, colitis, and atherosclerosis to pick apart the functional role efferocytosis and key regulatory players. The overall goal of these studies is to eventually benefit from manipulating the efferocytic process in disease states."
"Reichhardt, Courtney"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"The overarching goal of the Reichhardt Lab is to discover the fundamental biophysical principles of biofilm assembly. Within biofilms, aggregates of microbes are encased in a mesh-like, biopolymer-rich matrix that promotes microbial cell-cell interactions, adherence to host tissues, and protection from antimicrobials. These properties contribute to biofilms causing difficult-to-treat chronic infections.
Despite the importance of the biofilm matrix, we still do not understand how individual matrix components are assembled into a functional architecture. Since this problem spans several scales-multicellular to atomic-new multidisciplinary approaches are required. Therefore, we are developing approaches that integrate microbiological methods with physical chemistry tools including microscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Overall, our research program aims to provide critical understanding of biofilm assembly, with broader impact on bacterial physiology, materials science, and treatment for chronic infections.
Biofilm matrix dynamics:Biological materials-including the biofilm matrix-are dynamic, with properties and functions that change in response to environmental cues. We are applying solid-state NMR and microscopy to explore how biofilm matrix interactions change over the course of the biofilm lifecycle.
Integration of host material into biofilms:An incredibly important feature of biofilm infections is the host environment. However, in general, only self-produced biofilm matrix has been characterized. We are developing solid-state NMR and microscopy approaches to examine total infection-relevant biofilm composition.
Biofilms in CF lung infections:Material from CF lung infections can be analyzed by solid-state NMRPeople with cystic fibrosis (CF) have recurrent lung infections that are thought to be biofilm-involved infections.

For my undergraduate education. I obtained a Honours Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Toronto in Theoretical Physiology and Mathematics which taught me how to model biological systems using principles of math, physics and chemistry. I was first introduced to membrane proteins in the laboratory of Dr. Peter Backx, where I carried out research on the mathematical modeling of the cardiac action potential as well as experimental. electrophysiological studies of voltage-gated sodium channels. During my PhD with Dr. BenoTt Roux and Dr. Larry Palmer at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, I applied these fundamentals to computational studies aimed at investigating how changes in inward rectifier potassium channel sequence leads to changes in function (Robertson and Roux, 2005; Zhang et al., 2004; Robertson et al., 2008; 2012; 2010b). My postdoctoral training with Dr. Chris Miller at HHMI/Brandeis University immersed me in experimental membrane protein biochemistry, investigating the structure and function of anion transporters and channels (Jayaram et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2010a; Stockbridge et al., 2013). After receiving a K99 award, I studied with Dr. Jeff Gelles at Brandeis University to learn single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and apply this technique to the study of reversible CLC dimerization in lipid bilayers as a model system to investigate the physical driving forces involved in self-assembly of proteins in membranes. The subject of membrane protein biochemistry is currently primed for a productive combination of theory and experiments. With my background, I am uniquely trained to integrate these areas into one laboratory and overcome the hurdles currently existing in the field while training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. In July 2013, I set up my laboratory at the University of Iowa in the Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, and in September 2018, we moved to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Washington University. In my lab, we integrate experimental techniques such as biochemistry, electrophysiology, crystallography and single-molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRFJ microscopy, with theoretical computer modeling, to study membrane protein systems in membranes. We have built our own multi-color co-localization TIRF microscope (Lambda II, and now Ill) following the Gelles lab design, which has fostered numerous collaborations with membrane protein physiologists interested in single-molecule and whole-cell TIRF imaging (e.g. Ahern laboratory, University of Iowa (Leisle et al., 2016); Sah Laboratory, University of Iowa and Washington University, ROl DK106009, NIH/NIDDK; Senes Laboratory CHE-1710183, NSF. University of Wisconsin - Madison). However, the primary goal of my laboratory is to understand how and why membrane proteins self-assemble (i.e. fold), form stable complexes. and achieve conformational stability inside of the oil-filled cell membrane. This is a challenging, and consequently, poorly understood area that is fundamental to cell biology.

"Rubin, Deborah"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"			"Our laboratoryÕs major focus is in the study of gastrointestinal epithelial cell biology, specifically in examining molecular mechanisms regulating its proliferation and differentiation.  Our two major projects are briefly described:1.   Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in gut epithelial proliferation and carcinogenesis.   Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are required for normal intestinal morphogenesis and have a critical role in carcinogenesis in epithelial tissues.  Epimorphin, a member of the syntaxin family of vesicle docking proteins, is a mesenchymal and myofibroblast protein with an important role in epithelial morphogenesis.  To elucidate its biological function we generated epimorphin-/- (epi-/-) mice, which are viable yet manifest a phenotype including increased small bowel length, increased mucosal surface area, increased crypt cell proliferation and increased crypt fission.    This phenotype derives, at least in part, from effects on bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), Wnt-§-catenin and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways.  These data are consistent with our observation that aged Epi-/- mice have a significantly increased incidence of spontaneous small bowel adenomatous polyps, and occasionally develop invasive cancer. Our observations suggest that the net effect of stromal myofibroblast secretion mediated by epi in the intestine is to act as a ÒbrakeÓ on crypt cell proliferation and crypt fission.  Thus, perturbing normal secretion by extinguishing epimorphin expression stimulates crypt cell proliferation and fission.  Over time, we predict that this promotes adenomatous polyp formation and malignant transformation.Our research focuses on determining the mechanisms by which epimorphin deletion leads to enhanced crypt cell proliferation and small intestinal polyp formation.  The tumorigenic phenotype of Epi-/- mice is being assessed by determining the temporal, regional and histologic characteristics of the small bowel polyps and carcinomas.  Effects of epi deletion on secretion of Bmps and other growth factors, and on Bmp, Hh and wnt-§-catenin signaling pathways are being examined in the small bowel and colon of Epi-/- mice and in Epi-/-  and WT myofibroblasts.  In addition, we use using myofibroblast-epithelial co-culture models to examine the effects of epimorphin overexpression and inhibition on Bmp activity.  Bmps modulate the wnt-§-catenin pathway via effects on §-catenin nuclear localization, and Bmp4 is a downstream target of the Hh signaling pathway. Thus we are determining  how epimorphin overexpression and inhibition regulates these pathways, using in vitro model systems. 2.  Molecular regulation of the proliferative and functional adaptive response of the small intestinal epithelium following loss of functional small bowel surface area.  Following loss of functional small bowel surface area resulting from surgical resection or from ischemia, trauma, radiation or diseases such as CrohnÕs disease, the remnant intestine undergoes a robust adaptive response.  This is characterized by enhanced crypt cell proliferation, resulting in increased villus height, crypt depth and enterocyte migration as well as enhanced nutrient absorption. Our laboratory has been interested in determining the molecular regulation of this response, particularly focusing on mechanisms underlying enhanced epithelial function and crypt cell proliferation and apoptosis. Recently we have elucidated the role of an immediate early gene, TIS7, in the gut during adaptation following resection.  TIS7 is markedly upregulated during the early adaptive response. Transgenic mice that overexpress TIS7 in the small intestine have increased adiposity but lower growth rates compared to their normal littermates, and an enhanced rate of intestinal lipid absorption.  In contrast, TIS7 null mice are protected from weight gain on a high fat diet.  Studies presently focus on determining the mechanisms underlying the adiposity and alterations"

In addition to liver mass being precisely regulated in proportion to body mass, this organ is also able to regenerate the anatomic and functional deficits incurred by many forms of injury or disease (e.g. toxin exposure, trauma, infection).  We use rodent partial hepatectomy and other models to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this remarkable regenerative potential, and have focused our recent efforts on defining and investigating the functional relevance of extrahepatic signals that influence regulation of liver mass and regeneration.  In addition, we began a translational line of investigation in which lessons learned about liver regeneration in this basic model are applied to analyses of human liver diseases.

Over the last few years it is becoming more and more evident that inflammation and adaptive immunity play a role in normal aging and neurological disorders. T cells are major component of the adaptive immune system and they recognize a diverse repertoire of antigens through T-cell receptors (TCRs). Major bottleneck in understanding T cell responses in health and disease is the diversity of TCRs and the vast variety of antigens that they can encounter. To circumvent these, we have taken a sequence-based approach to T cell responses and developed a robust single T cell TCR sequencing and phenotyping method and a bioinformatic analysis pipeline, which can group TCR sequences into clusters sharing specificity. Further, we have developed unbiased highthrouhput technologies to determine antigen specificity of TCRs. This is in contrast to traditional candidate approaches which involved a priori knowledge of the relevant antigens. By employing these technologies, we are exploring T cell responses at a Òsystems levelÓ in varied neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

These channels are major determinants of behavior and higher brain function. The potassium channels we study are involved in human disease (e.g. epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia), basic physiology (e.g. control of blood pressure, protection from hypoxia), and higher brain function (e.g. learning and memory). Our approach is a comparative genomic one which involves comparing the structure and function of potassium channels in different species (e.g. humans, rodents, Drosophila and the nematode worm C. elegans). These comparisons have led us to many fundamental insights about the basic function, development, and regulation of potassium channels, and their role in behavior. The techniques we use in our laboratory include genetics and genomics, the creation and use of transgenic animals, molecular biology, and biophysical studies which include electrophysiological recordings of both native cells and heterologous cell systems which we use to express our cloned channels.In general, ion channels are the major effector molecules through which neurotransmitters and many hormones act. Ion channels are the ÒtransistorsÓ (electronic switches) of the brain that generate and propagate electrical signals in the aqueous environment of the brain that resembles dilute seawater, a reflection of the evolutionary origin of the nervous system in the sea. Ion channels not only generate active electrical responses, but they set the resting potentials of cells, as well. Without them, life as we know it would not exist, much less higher brain function."

"Schreiber, Robert"	Cancer Biology	Immunology			"Our research focuses on elucidating the molecular cell biology of cytokine receptor signaling and on defining the role of cytokines and lymphocytes in controlling tumor development. First, we continue to pursue our long-standing interest in cytokine receptor signaling through the analysis of the structure and function of the receptors for interferon-gamma (IFNg), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Much of this work now involves the use of gene ablation and gene profiling techniques to generate mice that lack particular receptor signaling components and to characterize the physiologic outcomes of receptor engagement. This approach has led to the discovery of a novel alternative pathway of IFNg signaling and has helped to clarify the roles of the JAK-STAT and NF-kB signaling pathways in development of cytokine-induced biologic responses. Second, we have made a substantial commitment to defining the role of the immune response in controlling tumor development. Using genetically engineered mice that are insensitive to IFNg and/or that lack lymphocytes, we have shown that the immune system indeed protects the host against development of carcinogen-induced and spontaneous tumors. In this process, IFNg functions, at least in part, to enhance the immunogenicity of developing tumors and thereby facilitates their recognition by T lymphocytes. However, the collaborative actions of IFNg and lymphocytes sometimes favor the selection of tumor variants with reduced immunogenicity that are more capable of surviving in an immunocompetent host. Thus, tumors are imprinted by the immunological environment in which they develop, a process that we have termed Òtumor editingÓ. Current work is aimed at defining the molecular basis of tumor editing and in understanding the precise roles of IFNg and lymphocytes in this process.

In particular, we are studying the role of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in HSCs. TLRs are a family of pattern-recognition receptors that respond to pathogens and play a central role in the innate immune response. While much of the research on TLRs has focused on more committed effector cell types, recent studies suggest that TLRs may even influence the immune response from the level of the HSC. Both mouse and human HSCs express TLRs (Nagai, et al Immunity 2006; Sioud, et al J Mol Biol 2006), and in vitro exposure to TLR agonists has been shown to stimulate HSC cycling and skew HSC differentiation toward the myeloid lineage. Furthermore, chronic in vivo treatment of mice with the TLR4 agonist LPS leads to increased HSC cycling and expansion, but decreased repopulating activity with myeloid skewing in transplantation assays (Esplin, et al J Immunol 2011). Together, these studies suggest that TLR signaling may shape the immune response from the level of the HSC, regulating the proliferation, differentiation and activity of these cells. Finally, enhanced expression of TLRs and increased TLR signaling is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a stem cell disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a high risk of transformation to acute leukemia (Maratheftis, et al Clin Cancer Res 2007; Hoffman, et al Blood 2002; Starczynowki, et al Nature Medicine 2010; Wei, et al Leukemia 2013).Our lab is currently using mouse models to better define the role of individual TLRs in regulating HSC function. In addition, we are exploring the connection between enhanced TLR signaling and MDS through the use of various mouse models of this disease. Ultimately we hope that a better understanding of how inflammation and TLRs regulate HSCs will lead to the clinical application of specific agonists or antagonists to improve HSC function in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation or suffering from bone marrow failure or hematopoietic malignancies.

"Schwartz, Drew"	Computational and Systems Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"Bacterial infections are a leading cause of infant death worldwide. At birth, infants are colonized with bacteria from their mother and environment. Collectively, this bacterial population is called the microbiome, and it is vital for healthy human development. Preterm infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are the most susceptible to bacterial infections because of underdeveloped skin and gut barriers and other immature organ systems. Because bacterial infection affects up to 40% of preterm infants, antibiotics are frequently given for suspected or confirmed infection. When infants show signs of infection (sepsis), their blood is cultured to look for bacteria, and they are started on antibiotics. While awaiting results, infants are treated with antibiotics targeted at common causes of bloodstream infection, but this approach has negative consequences. First, many bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to being killed by the chosen antibiotics. Second, when antibiotics are given unnecessarily when no bacteria grow in culture, antibiotics are associated with increased likelihood of death. Finally, antibiotics disrupt the normal development of the infant gut microbiome and immune system and increase the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and risk of further episodes of sepsis.
My objective is to understand how disruption of the infant microbiome can result in serious bacterial infections. I want to answer the questions: why are some infants more susceptible to severe infections than others and can we predict who is at the greatest risk? My laboratory will integrate multi-omics modeling of informative perinatal and infant cohorts with mechanistic characterization in animal models to generate clinically actionable personalized microbiome-risk prediction and antibiotic stewardship in infants.

At Washington University we maintain one the largest tumor repositories for cervical cancer, which includes well annotated specimens collected before and during chemoradiation treatment. We are currently using this repository to test the influence of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) genotype and gene expression on cervical cancer outcomes, characterize the biology of HPV negative cervical tumors, and identify novel mutations associated with local recurrence and distant metastasis after treatment. We take these observations, derived directly from patient data, to the bench to conceptualize, optimize and test novel drug and radiotherapy combinations, which are then moved forward in the context of investigator-initiated clinical trials.The majority of the work done to date in the lab has focused on tumor metabolism, specifically increased rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis and the association between this metabolic phenotype and resistance to cancer treatment. We have had a long standing interest in the association between tumor glucose metabolism and radiation therapy resistance. This work has included clinical studies with 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans as well as preclinical studies performed in cancer cell lines and mouse tumor models, including patient derived xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models. We have used this approach to develop metabolic strategies that increase tumor oxidative stress and can be used to increase radiation sensitivity in treatment-resistant tumors. More recently, we have been developing new strategies that target tumor dependence on alternative carbon sources including glutamine and free fatty acids.Our work has now expanded to include the role of tumor immunology and the microenvironment in mediating cancer therapy resistance. This work includes active research collaborations with other laboratories studying additional tumor types (such as sarcoma and pancreatic cancer). Using 2D and 3D co-culture systems, we are studying how tumor cells and immune cells in microenvironment share (and compete for) nutrients and how this process impacts anti-tumor immunity.Current projects include:

Our work is translational, spanning cultured cells, animal models and humans.  Fatty acid metabolism is controlled in part by the nuclear receptor perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). We have demonstrated a role for this receptor in atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension in animal models and in blood pressure control in humans. Using tissue-specific inactivation of the rate-limiting enzyme in lipogenesis, fatty acid synthase (FAS), we have also shown that FAS generates an endogenous ligand responsible for PPARalpha activation. Ongoing studies are defining how FAS and PPARalpha interact to affect metabolism. Up to a quarter of Americans have some combination of abnormal lipids, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and excess abdominal fat. Collectively, these conditions constitute the metabolic syndrome, which confers considerable risk for frank diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We have shown that a mutation in the kinase ATM, known to be responsible for the cancer-prone disease ataxia telangiectasia, contributes to features of the metabolic syndrome in mice. Low dose, intermittent administration of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine activates ATM and improves metabolic abnormalities in mice. Mechanistic studies in animal models and clinical trials in humans are testing the hypothesis that ATM activation ameliorates the metabolic syndrome.

"Shaw, Paul"	Molecular Genetics and Genomics	Neurosciences			"Despite the fact that sleep is conserved throughout the animal kingdom, the function of sleep remains one of the last major unsolved biological mysteries facing neuroscience today. Human, rodent and fly studies clearly demonstrate that sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation. However, recent human studies reveal that sleep plays a much more intricate role in brain functioning than simply stabilizing and consolidating memories.  Indeed, sleep is vital for the off-line processing of information including improving creative thinking and promoting the discovery of creative insights:  An historical example is the discovery of the structure of the benzene ring during a dream.  My lab uses the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster to elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking sleep to neuronal plasticity. We have demonstrated that we can fully restore cognitive functioning to a diverse set of classic memory mutants simply by enhancing their sleep.  In these experiments, sleep was able to reverse cognitive deficits without restoring the causal molecular lesion or structural defect. In addition sleep reversed cognitive deficits in two separate models of AlzheimerÕs disease. Current studies are focused on the molecular mechanism that allows sleep to initiate such an extreme form of neuronal plasticity that allows sleep to reverse cognitive deficits even when they are caused by catastrophic genetic and structural lesions

"Sheets, Lavinia"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology	Neurosciences		"Hair cells are the sensory receptors of sound, motion, and spatial orientation. Overexposure to loud sounds initiates a series of molecular events in cochlear hair cells that contribute to various hair-cell pathologies: intense noise-exposures induce hair-cell death while moderate-noise exposures contribute to progressive hair-cell synapse loss, postsynaptic retraction, and cochlear nerve degeneration. Our research interests are to understand how specific pathological changes occur in hair cells overexposed to noise by defining the cellular mechanisms driving hair-cell synapse loss and hair-cell death, as well as identifying pathways that promote repair.My lab address these questions using zebrafish as a model for hearing and deafness. Zebrafish afford a powerful model system to uncover the cellular mechanisms of noiseinduced synaptopathy and hair-cell loss. Zebrafish sensory hair cells are homologous to mammalian hair cells, and there is a high conservation of zebrafish deafness gene function compared with humans. In contrast to other vertebrate model organisms, zebrafish hair cells are optically accessible in whole larvae within the ear and the lateral line organ-a sensory organ used to detect the movement of water. Additionally, zebrafish hair cells are amenable to pharmacological manipulation, allowing for large scale drug screening and subsequent examination of hair-cell morphology and function. Moreover, as zebrafish have an extensive capacity for regeneration of complex tissues, including hair cells and afferent neurons, they can be used to identify molecular pathways that promote synapse regeneration following hair-cell damage.

Typically, cataract is progressively acquired with aging (>40 years) as a complex trait with high heritability involving poorly understood gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. However, many genetic forms of cataract are known that present at an early age (birth-40 years) with or without systemic abnormalities and/or other ocular disorders. In particular, cataract may be inherited with abnormalities of anterior eye structures (cornea, iris, ciliary body and irridocorneal-angle drainage system) greatly increasing the risk for developing glaucoma Ð a blinding disease that progressively destroys the optic nerve. By studying genetic forms of cataract we hope to gain new insights about lens and anterior eye development, and to discover candidate genes for age-related cataract. So far we have identified mutations in 11 genes for inherited cataract; one of which is also associated with age-related cataract, and one with glaucoma. Currently we have ongoing research projects in two complementary areas: (1) Gene discovery: Genetic linkage analysis and targeted (exome) next-generation sequencing techniques are being used to (a) map and identify genes for inherited cataract, (b) develop diagnostic genetic tests for cataract and associated eye disorders, (c) identify risk variants in candidate genes for age-related cataract, and (d) identify the underlying gene in a mouse model of human age-related cataract. (2) Functional expression studies: Gene-targeted mice are being used to model the roles of (a) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in lens development and aging, (b) a novel cation channel in lens and anterior eye development, (c) a multi-vesicular endosome protein in lens development, and (d) ER-stress and apoptosis in cataract development.

Proteases are the major executioners of cell death, and are blocked, in part, by endogenous inhibitors such as serpins. Our laboratory focuses on the interplay between cell stress (e.g., infection, hypoxia, hyperoxia, and electrolyte disturbances), protease activation, and serpin blockade. Using multiple technologies (e.g., live-cell imaging, chemical mutagenesis, RNAi, and CRISPR/Cas9) in C. elegans, mouse, and cell culture models of human diseases, we show that serpins serve as pro-survival factors. Certain serpins neutralize lysosomal cysteine proteases, and block a novel form of regulated cell death, lysosomal-mediated necrosis. This cell death pathway is activated after major cellular insults as occurs in newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis or after severe bacterial infections. We are further defining the genetic and molecular basis of this pathway, and are searching for compounds that inhibit this form of cell death. Interestingly, however, serpins are metastable proteins and some mutations in serpin genes lead to the synthesis of misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins that induce cellular stress themselves. These conformational diseases, called serpinopathies (a subset of the proteinopathies or conformational diseases), perturb proteostasis and induce cellular injury. The canonical serpinopathy, a1-antitrypsin (AT) deficiency (ATD), results in the aggregation and retention of AT in the ER of liver cells where it causes inflammation, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. ATD is a prototype for other conformational diseases such as AlzheimerÕs, HuntingtonÕs, and ParkinsonÕs diseases, but is unique in that the misfolded proteins are retained in the ER. Since there are no known cures for these conformational disorders, we tested the feasibility of modeling ATD in C. elegans, and using this powerful genetic system to conduct high-throughput drug and genetic screens to search for hit compounds and modifier genes that serve as new therapeutic targets, respectively. This semi-automated, highly reproducible, live-animal, high throughput drug discovery platform rivals that of any cell-based system. Early findings of this pre-clinical work show that FDA-approved drugs can be re-purposed and used to reduce ATZ accumulation and cellular toxicity by enhancing autophagy.

Much of our work is focused spatial processing for guiding eye and arm movements.Parietal cortex provides an earlier link in the transformation of visual sensory information into motor commands. Patients with unilateral parietal damage may ignore objects in one half of the world. In severe cases, they may clothe only half of their body or eat from only half of their plate. Spatial memory is affected, and there are often motor deficits as well.We record from individual neurons in the parietal cortex of macaque monkeys during complex tasks in order to understand the role of the cortex in the sensory-motor transformation. The animals are trained to look at and reach for colored spots of light Ñ a monkey video game. We ask how the locations of these spots are represented by neural activity in the brain. What frame of reference is used? Is there a single, generic representation or multiple special purpose representations? How is spatial information from other sensory systems combined with visually-derived information? How is spatial information stored (memory)? How does the nature of the task, and what the animal intends to do, affect parietal processing? Is parietal cortex specifically involved in the learning of new sensory-motor mappings, or in coordinating eye and hand movement?We perform our studies primarily in macaque monkeys, using single and multi-unit neuron recording, reversible inactivation of cortical areas, and MR-based tract tracing, functional MRI activation studies, and functional MRI connectivity studies.

During this period, Song group has demonstrated that DTI derived axial and radial diffusivity accurately reflects mouse CNS white matter injury. The approach has been translated to patients of multiple sclerosis (MS) and cervical spinal cord injury patients. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion MRI biomarker of CNS injury, a novel diffusion MRI method, diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI), has recently been developed to resolve the intravoxel partial volume effect to correctly estimate axial and radial diffusivity of axonal fibers in the presence of inflammation and/or tissue loss. One of the crucial utilities of DBSI is its ability to detect and quantify the extent of increased cellularity and edema associated with CNS inflammation.  In addition to the development of the biomarker of CNS injury, Song lab has also reported the first successful diffusion fMRI to non-invasively detect the activation of mouse optic nerve.

"Souroullas, George"	Cancer Biology	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology		"The Souroullas Lab is studying the role of epigenetic mechanisms during cancer development, with a specific interest in hematopoietic/lymphoid malignancies and melanoma.  Epigenetic regulation is a very dynamic process which involves three main components: (1) Writers: These are proteins which catalyze the addition of chemical groups on the DNA or chromatin, (2) Readers:  Proteins which recognize these chemical groups, interact with them, interpret them and transmit further downstream signals.  (3) Erasers:  Proteins that recognize these marks and catalyze their removal (Fig. 1).  Under homeostatic conditions, these epigenetic mechanisms can directly regulate fundamental processes within the cell, such as DNA transcription, replication, repair, cell identity, growth and proliferation.  These cellular processes are commonly implicated and deregulated in cancer.  Furthermore, recent next generation sequencing studies have identified mutations in many epigenetic factors in multiple cancers, suggesting that epigenetics must play an important role during cancer development.  The reversible nature of the activity of these proteins presents us with an incredible opportunity in translational medicine.  Understanding the phenotypic and molecular consequences of epigenetic dysregulation during carcinogenesis remains a challenge, but it is critical in developing more effective therapeutic strategies.  Our lab is interested in exploring how epigenetic mechanisms and chromatin dynamics contribute towards the development of cancer (Fig. 2).  Towards that end, we utilize genetically engineered mouse models in combination with molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches.  Overall, our goal, is to explore how epigenetic mechanisms interact under homeostatic conditions, how those interactions are perturbed in cancer, how they interact with other oncogenic/genetic events and how we can take advantage of this knowledge to design more effective therapeutic strategies.  Current projects in the lab are focused on the suppressive chromatin mark H3K27me3, which is deposited by the PRC2 complex and its catalytic subunit, EZH2.  We are specifically interested in the role of EZH2 Y641 mutations during the development of B cell lymphoma and melanoma because of the high incidence of these mutations in these two cancers.  Ongoing projects in the lab include:¥	Understand how mutations in EZH2 change the chromatin landscape and explore how these chromatin changes determine deposition and interpretation of other chromatin marks¥	Investigation of the downstream effects of the neomorphic EZH2 Y641 mutations in B cell lymphoma and melanoma ¥	Understand the genetic and molecular interactions between mutations in EZH2 and other oncogenic events

"Stein, Paul"	Neurosciences				"Tactile inputs excite neural networks in the spinal cord that produce patterns of motor output responsible for specific behaviors (Stein, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2018). We study the physiology of spinal networks that generate the scratch reflex. A turtle with a complete transection of the spinal cord exhibits a scratch reflex in response to tactile stimulation of a specific site on the body surface. During a scratch, a limb reaches toward and rubs against the stimulated site. We stimulate sites on the turtle shell to elicit three different types or ""forms"" of scratching. We have characterized the patterns of muscular activation during these three forms. After immobilization of the spinal turtle with a neuromuscular blocking agent, tactile stimulation of a specific site will elicit a pattern of motor neuron activity that is an excellent replica of the sequence of muscle activity recorded in the mobile preparation. This pattern, recorded from peripheral nerves of the immobilized animal, is termed ""fictive"" since it occurs in the absence of actual movements. We test hypotheses of modular spinal cord motor pattern generation. We study preparations that can produce either a flexor rhythm, an extensor rhythm, or rhythmic alternation between flexor and extensor activation. We use extracellular microsuction electrodes to obtain single-unit axonal recordings of interneurons. These recordings provide support for the concept of modular spinal cord organization (Stein and Daniels-McQueen, 2002, 2004; Stein, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2018; Stein et al., 2016).

These units may be the same, as with the evolution of multicellularity, or they may be different, as with the evolution of the eukaryote cell. For such cooperation to evolve, conflicts at lower levels must be controlled. We study the evolution of cooperation and the control of conflict in a microbial eukaryote, the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. It is uniquely suitable for this work because transitions that are fixed in most organisms are still flexible. This amoeba preys on bacteria but, when starved, aggregates into a multicellular body that moves towards light, and then differentiates into 20% dead stalk cells that support 80% living spore cells. When the multicellular stage is chimeric, the opportunity for one clone to cheat the other arises. We identify genes involved in this process, look at their rates of evolution using 20 resequenced clones and a handful of sequenced closely related species. We use experimental evolution to look at the robustness of the social process and the importance of high genetic relatedness within fruiting bodies in maintaining the altruistic caste. We explore kin recognition and its genetic basis. We study the evolution of development by constructing pseudo-organisms with artificial life cycles where we manipulate things like single-cell bottlenecks. We have found that some clones carry bacteria with them in a farming and defensive mutualism, and use this to experimentally study mutualism. In sum, our group studies whatÕs crucial to organismality.

"Stratman, Amber"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Molecular Cell Biology		"To build a functionally stable blood vessel that is able to withstand changes in shear stress and modulate vascular tone requires cooperation between two cell types: the endothelial cell (EC) and the mural cell (MC). MCs, a perivascular cell population that provides structural support to EC tube networks, can be split into subclasses, including smooth muscle cells and pericytes, based on the anatomical location of the MC population within the vascular network. EC-MC interactions are known to be critical in stabilizing the vasculature by helping to withstand forces such as high shear stress/pulsatile pressure exerted on the vessels from blood flow coming out of the heart. MCs also promote barrier function at the blood brain barrier (BBB). Despite the critical nature of these cell-to-cell interactions, much more is known about genes regulating EC versus MC function.Many diseases such as atherosclerosis/restenosis, cancer, stroke and diabetic retinopathies have known connections to vascular dysfunction exemplified by targeted disruptions in MC support of the vasculature. In diabetic retinopathy for instance, there is thought to be a drop-out of MCs surrounding blood vessels, making the remaining vasculature much more susceptible to micro-hemorrhages that are ultimately responsible for the blindness associated with the disorder. In atherosclerotic plaques, MCs are known to dedifferentiate to adopt a synthetic matrix producing phenotype that has been intimately connected to the progression of the disease. Despite the fact that there is a known phenotypic relationship between multiple diseases and MCs, there is an associated lack of mechanistic understanding of normal MC function to effectively develop specific therapeutics targeted at prevention and treatment of disorders. Therefore, my labs long-term research interests focus on understanding MC biology during development and disease.My lab uses zebrafish to study MC development and behavior. Zebrafish as a vertebrate model organism offer a number of advantages that make it an ideal system to study development of the vascular wall- including external fertilization, proper embryonic growth in the absence of functional vasculature or blood flow, optical clarity for longitudinal imaging, and genetic/experimental accessibility. The field remains largely uncharted giving us the unique opportunity to exploit newly developed tools to broaden the understanding of MC biology and the mechanisms regulating their behavior. Research in my laboratory will aid in the understanding of developmental processes regulating MC function and will in turn 1) provide a broader understanding of how the blood vessel wall is assembled, 2) define genetic pathways critical for MC function and 3) provide a platform to assess dysfunction in EC-MC interactions during disease.

"Sykes, Stephen"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Cancer Biology	Molecular Cell Biology		"The Role and Regulation of Metabolic Processes in Hematopoiesis and Leukemia
The principal objective of my laboratory is to identify and define those molecular features that drive leukemogenesis and then use that information to develop rational therapeutic strategies for improving outcomes in acute leukemia.
The lab is most interested in molecular pathways that: 1) are differentially regulated between malignant cells and their healthy counterparts; 2) promote resistance to conventional chemotherapies; and 3) support leukemia stem cell biology. Based on these criteria, lab projects fall within one or more of the following three themes:
1. Intracellular Metabolism: Due to the distinct metabolic dependencies of many human cancers, cellular metabolism has emerged as both a major point of investigation and therapeutic targeting in cancer biology. Based our recently published studies, we are currently investigating the following metabolic processes in acute leukemia: Amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, cellular energetics and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism.
2. Unfolded Protein Response: The unfolded protein response or UPR is a signal transduction network that helps cells negotiate multiple cellular stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, metabolic stress, responses to chemotherapy and more. We and others have shown that certain sub-types of acute leukemia are highly dependent upon UPR signaling. To extend these findings, we are currently focused on determining the upstream and downstream UPR components that support acute leukemia as well as assessing the therapeutic efficacy of targeting these pathways in leukemia.
3. Regulation of Mitochondrial Biology: Mitochondria represent the engines of the cell and are often commandeered for the purpose of maximal energy output in many forms of human cancer, including acute leukemia. While these organelles are often strictly thought of as energy generators, mitochondria are increasingly being recognized as multi-faceted systems that require an ensemble of regulators to maintain proper function. Our aim is to elucidate these regulators and in particular those that are hijacked in human cancer.
Importantly, because leukemia arises from mutated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) I am also very interested in assessing how these pathways influence healthy HSPC biology."

"Taghert, Paul"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Neurosciences			"My laboratory studies two major questions in circadian neurobiology using the model system Drosophila. First, we ask how circadian timing information is organized in neuronal circuits to regulate daily behavior.  In Drosophila, a small (150) complement of neuronal pacemakers in the fly brain have special dedication to circadian timekeeping and control daily rhythmic locomotor behavior.  Using novel imaging methods in collaboration with Tim Holy (Neuroscience, WUMS) to measure calcium levels brain-wide in vivo over 24 hr, we found that different circadian pacemaker groups are sequentially active at precise times of day. These represent different temporal outputs of the circadian pacemaker circuit, presumably controlling different physiological functions, (e.g., sensory, motor, integrative functions).  Thus the circadian timing circuit of the fly brain produces multiple timing cues across the 24 hr cycle: we aim to define the respective downstream circuits controlled by these different circadian output elements and to define the endpoints they gate.The sequential activation pattern is unexpected because these dynamic calcium oscillations depend on the circadian molecular clock within each pacemaker which runs synchronously across the network.  Thus the second area we study is the cellular and molecular basis for decoding synchronous circadian timing system into staggered neuronal activation patterns.  Predominantly, the transformation results from a series of suppressive signals within the network, representing numerous cell interactions mediated by neuropeptides.  Morning appears to be the cardinal phase for neuronal activation, and all pacemaker groups except the canonical ÒMorning PacemakersÓ are delayed by many hours via neuropeptide-mediated suppression of their calcium levels. The novel, long-lasting and pervasive nature of these suppressive signals prompt us to study the signaling details by which neuropeptides (like PDF) regulate calcium levels.  We have shown that activation of the receptor for PDF (a GPCR) generates cAMP via certain adenylate cyclases, and that receptivity to PDF is itself daily rhythmic, with a peak at dawn (which is when behaviorally-functional signaling takes place).  Further the rhythm of sensitivity is gated by the small GTPase Ral A.  Ultimately we would like to understand how this GPCR signals to control the phases of daily calcium peaks in different pacemaker neurons.

Accordingly, perception adapts to top-down information that is learned through experience, such as the salience or valence of sensory stimuli. We use coarse-grained statistical approaches as well as detailed biophysical models to unravel the brain mechanisms that underpin perceptual learning. We focus on the olfactory system but sometimes our models are sufficiently abstract to be applicable across sensory modalities. Currently, we are interested in understanding the function of adult neurogenesis, a striking form of plasticity specific to the olfactory system. Our goal is to provide insights into the computational principles and biophysical conditions that make adult neurogenesis advantageous for olfactory perceptual learning compared to more common (e.g. synaptic) forms of plasticity.

We utilize the unique properties of the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its multicellular relatives including Volvox carteri to investigate questions at the interfaces of evolution, developmental biology, cell biology and metabolism. ÊCurrent projects include:
Evolution of sex and sexual dimorphism. ÊSexes and sexual dimorphism have fascinated evolutionary biologists since Darwin first developed the theory of sexual selection. Male-female dimorphism evolved from mating types in volvocine algae under the control of a complex mating locus and an associated transcription factor called MID from the RWP-RK family. ÊWe investigate how the MID network coevolved with volvocine algal sex chromosomes and sex determination mechanisms in the transition from mating types to sexes.
Origins and evolution of germ-soma differentiation.ÊOne of the most common innovations in multicellular life is the separation of an immortal germ lineage from terminally differentiated somatic cells. ÊThe multicellular alga Volvox has evolved complete-germ soma differentiation under the genetic control of several key regulators including the putative transcriptional repressor, regA. ÊWe are investigating the targets of regA and how its expression causes terminal differentiation and senescence inn somatic cells.Ê
Cell size homeostasis and the retinoblastoma (RB)tumor suppressor complex in Chlamydomonas.Chlamydomonas cells divide by multiple fission and control size by modulating the number of divisions that a mother cell undergoes in each cycle. ÊThe RB protein complex is a key regulator of size control and is part of a size sensing pathway that includes upstream cyclin dependent kinases and a musashi-like RNA binding protein. ÊWe are developing methods to investigate how upstream regulators respond to cell size and the mechanisms by which the RB complex activates or represses cell cycle progression through non-transcriptional effects on chromatin.
TOR kinase and inositol polyphosphate signaling in the control of cell growth and carbon partitioning in Chlamydomonas.ÊProliferating cells must integrate nutritional information with biosynthetic processes to maintain balanced growth. ÊThe target of rapamycin (TOR) protein kinase is a conserved growth regulator across eukaryotes. We recently found a novel interaction between TOR signaling and the inositol polyphosphate (InsP) biosynthetic pathway in Chlamydomonas. ÊMutants in the InsP kinase VIP1 are hypersensitive to TOR inhibition and have metabolic defects leading to increased neutral lipid accumulation. ÊThis finding has practical implications for engineering algae for biofuel production, and opens up a new avenue for investigating metabolism and carbon partitioning under the control of InsPs.

This condition is characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes, optic nerve atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus and neurodegeneration, and it may result in death in middle adulthood. Accumulating evidence in my laboratory strongly suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction is a critical pathogenic component of Wolfram syndrome. However, a complete understanding of the pathways and biomarkers involved in the disease process is still lacking. As a result, despite the underlying importance of ER dysfunction in Wolfram syndrome, there are currently no therapies that target the ER. The goal of our laboratory is to reveal the molecular mechanisms of Wolfram syndrome and develop patient-based therapeutics for this complex disorder using genetic information from each patient and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Growing evidence indicates that ER dysfunction is involved in rare genetics disorders, including Wolfram syndrome, as well as more common diseases such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes and Parkinson diseases. Thus, the potential public health implications of our research are considerable.

My approach to this challenge spans multiple scales, working to understand how molecules give rise to specific viral phenotypes, and how these phenotypes determine the virusÕs ability to propagate under the constraints found in cells, tissues, and organisms. To pursue this goal, I develop new chemical tools for imaging and reconstituting enveloped virus assembly and new technologies for modeling the physiological environment in which replication takes place. These tools will help determine the mechanistic links between the molecular basis of virus assembly and the transmission of viruses within and between hosts. An engineering-level understanding of how enveloped viruses assemble and navigate the host environment will establish a foundation for understanding a wide variety of other questions in biological assembly, for identifying new small molecule inhibitors of virus assembly, and for developing new virus-based anticancer therapies."

They produce nearly half of all known microbial bioactive natural products, and nearly 2/3rds of our clinically- utilized antibiotics. They strongly impact medicine and agriculture as producers of human and animal therapeutics, molecular probes, and crop protective agents.
Although these bacteria are a traditional source of valuable molecules, more recent genome analyses indicate that only a small fraction of their biosynthetic potential has been tapped thus far. This realization has engendered a new research paradigm; that of sequencing-based molecule discovery. Cognizant of the true molecule production capacity of these organisms, weÕre now enabled to begin deciphering the evolutionary roles of their unique chemistry while creating opportunities to discover novel pharmacophores."

"Verma, Priyanka"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Cancer Biology	Molecular Cell Biology		"With an overarching goal to understand the causes and consequences of DNA damage in cancers, research in my lab aims to answer the following questions:
What dictates cellular responses to chemotherapies that target DNA repair pathways?DNA repair pathways have been the target of multiple FDA-approved and experimental chemotherapies. The success of these therapies depends on the increased reliance of rapidly proliferating cancer cells on DNA replication and repair pathways. However, holistic responses to chemotherapies are an amalgamation of multiple cellular pathways and physiological settings. We are interested in decoding the molecular determinants that dictate chemotherapeutic response with the broad goal of tailoring treatment regimens and uncovering biological circuits that ensure genomic stability.
How cancer cells deal with roadblocks to replication?ÊOncogenic transformations are often associated with genomic alterations that can challenge DNA replication. ÊOwing to the essentiality of genome duplication for cell survival, cancers evolve pathways to surmount obstacles to replication. Intriguingly, depending on the cellular context, these obstacles come in Òdifferent flavorsÓ. By designing genetically defined systems to mimic different replication stress responses, the lab aims to define genome rescue mechanisms that are common and unique across cancer types. Ê
What are the endogenous DNA lesions in BRCA-mutant cancer cells?ÊCancers are characterized by aberrations in chromosomal numbers and characteristic DNA lesions, including damaged replication forks, single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks. The endogenous sources of these abnormalities remain unclear. In theory, any unresolved chemical modification in the nucleotide backbone of DNA can be the initiating molecular event for genomic instability when HR fails. We are interested in examining the unexplored link between nucleotide abnormalities and oncogenic transformations in HR-deficient cancers. These findings can be the key to understanding the innate molecular events that led to malignancy, and perhaps also reveal the basis for the known predilection of HR deficiency to result in cancers only in specific tissue types. This information can result in the discovery of biomarkers that can aid in the early detection of cancer. It may also be used to avoid exogenous exposures that lead to the genesis of such precipitating lesions.
We employ advanced CRISPR genetic screens and cancer genome mining tools to uncover biological circuits that are essential in cells with compromised DNA repair. This information is then combined with several biochemical and cellular tools to decode the mechanisms and consequences of these cancer-specific re-wiring events.

"Vindigni, Alessandro"	Cancer Biology	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics		"We focus on DNA replication and repair, and the roles of these pathways on cancer initiation, progression and response to chemotherapy. The environment of our laboratory offers a unique combination of biochemical, cellular, and structural approaches that is ideal for the training of students and postdoctoral fellows interested in studying the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of genome integrity. We are one of the few labs worldwide that combines biochemical, cellular, and electronic microscopy approaches to study perturbations of replication fork dynamics at single-molecule resolution. Using these technologies, we made seminal contributions toward the understanding of central pathways by which DNA replication responds to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Specifically, we identified key determinants required for replication fork reversal that allows replication forks to reverse their course when they face DNA lesions. We also elucidated mechanisms of replication fork repriming that allows replication forks to skip lesions introduced by DNA-damaging agents, leaving a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap between the lesion and the point where DNA synthesis resumes. Moreover, we uncovered the post-replicative mechanisms in charge of repairing the ssDNA gaps that form upon repriming. Importantly, ssDNA gaps have recently emerged as key determinants for genome stability and chemotherapy response. Our findings provided key insights on how to target these gap repair pathways to increase chemotherapy sensitivity. Going forward, we seek to further dissect the molecular mechanisms driving the cancer cell response to chemotherapeutics. These studies are paramount not only to develop novel and more effective chemotherapeutic strategies, but also to understand why efficacy of DNA damaging chemotherapy is frequently hampered by the development of chemoresistance. In particular, we will exploit the knowledge emerging from our mechanistic studies to test whether mutations or changes in the expression level of factors involved in replication fork stability may be linked to development of chemoresistance in cancer cells carrying mutations in DNA repair genes. In addition to our research, we are part of the newly established Siteman Center for Genome Integrity that fosters interactions and new collaborations between clinical and basic research scientists working on closely-related areas of DNA damage response, DNA replication and repair, chromatin biology, and gene regulation.Ê

"Vogel, Joseph"	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics	Molecular Microbiology and Microbial Pathogenesis		"My laboratory is interested in how pathogens are able to survive and replicate inside host cells. We have chosen to focus on one bacterial pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, that is able to grow inside the hostile environment of professional phagocytic cells such as macrophages and fresh water amoebae. Growth of L. pneumophila inside alveolar macrophages of the human lung results in a potentially fatal form of pneumonia called LegionnairesÕ disease. L. pneumophila is able to survive inside host cells by preventing fusion of the nascent phagosome with the degradative compartment, the lysosome.We have discovered a large number of L. pneumophila genes that are absolutely required for intracellular replication. These genes are called ÒdotÓ for defect in organelle trafficking because mutant strains lacking these genes are unable to perturb the normal endocytic pathway of the macrophage. Based on similarities between the dot genes and bacterial conjugation systems, we believe that the dot machine constitutes an export apparatus that evolved from a plasmid transfer system. The dot secretion complex presumably is used to deposit virulence factor(s) into host cells that are then responsible for preventing phagosome-lysosome fusion. In addition to L. pneumophila, a number of other pathogens including Bordetella pertussis, Helicobacter pylori, and Brucella abortus contain related complexes which have all been classified as type IV secretion systems. Determining how these specialized export apparatuses function will allow us to understand how these pathogens cause disease and reveal methods to prevent or inhibit their action.

Human growth, development, aging and disease alter these mechanical forces and often lead to a negative feedback cycle that exacerbates the loads on the heart and causes cardiac hypertrophy and eventual cardiac failure and death. I specifically focus on diseases that alter the amount of extracellular matrix (ECM) material in the wall of the blood vessels. Altering the amount of ECM proteins affects the wall composition, which changes the mechanical properties and consequently the mechanical loads on the heart and vessels. The major ECM proteins in the large, elastic arteries are collagen and elastin. Elastin provides reversible extensibility during the cardiac cycle, while collagen provides strength at high pressures. I study how changes in elastin amounts and/or organization alter the structure and mechanical function of blood vessels. I have access to mouse models with genetic mutations that alter the amount or organization of elastin in the vessels. I use structural and mechanical data from these mice in mathematical models that predict the effects of varying elastin amounts or organization and interventions such as changing the blood flow or blood pressure.

"Wan, Xiaoxiao"	Immunology				"Our laboratory focuses on examining pathogenic events responsible for initiating the development of tissue-specific autoimmune diseases. We primarily employ mouse experimental models to mechanistically dissect key factors involved in type 1 diabetes, a deteriorating autoimmune disorder that eventually destroys insulin-producing _-cells in the pancreatic islets. The research projects center on 1) Identifying antigenic targets involved in disease pathogenesis, which not only serves as a platform for activating antigen-specific autoreactive T cells but also can be used as diagnostic and therapeutic targets; 2) Examining the biological behaviors of the tissue innate immune system that finely tunes tissue homeostasis and shapes the phenotypic signatures of localized autoimmunity.
We recently identified a specific site in pancreatic _ cells, the crinosomes, responsible for generating disease-relevant peptides. Crinosomes are a specific set of vesicles formed by fusion of insulin granules with lysosomes. As an enzyme-rich structure, crinosomes not only generate unique or ÒcrypticÓ epitopes from degraded protein segments but also produce neoepitopes formed by post-translational modifications. These immunogenic materials are released into circulation during _-cell degranulation and become an antigen source for sensitizing peripheral lymphoid tissues. We aim to better understand crinosome biology and apply this knowledge to diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of type 1 diabetes. Using a platform integrating mass spectrometry with immunological characterization, we are moving forward to determine disease-relevant epitopes in the islets and peripheral blood from humans with type 1 diabetes.
The pancreatic islet is a mini-organ essential for maintaining body metabolism. This tissue contains several types of endocrine cells, including the insulin-producing _ cells, but only consists of one immune cell, the resident macrophages. Lineage tracing studies indicate that islet macrophages derive from definitive hematopoiesis. The islet macrophages are in intimate contact with _ cells, extending long filopodia in between them. Some of these filopodia enter the blood lumen and can capture microparticles. Islet macrophages isolated from different mouse strains (NOD, NOD.Rag1-/-, B6) have a high expression of genes encoding MHC-II, costimulatory molecules, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We consider such an activation state as a self-defensive mechanism for protecting the islets from pathogen infections. However, autoimmune risk can also be precipitated to foster incoming autoimmune responses. We seek to dissect the key factors expressed by the islet macrophages that not only influence _-cell biology during homeostasis but also play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes."

"Weilbaecher, Katherine"	Cancer Biology	Molecular Cell Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics		"The laboratory of Dr. Katherine Weilbaecher studies the molecular pathogenesis of bone metastasis. The laboratory has demonstrated that beta 3 integrins expressed on platelets and osteoclasts mediate metastatic progression, and that tumor induced dysregulation of platelet and osteoclast function may be a critical downstream mediator of bone metastasis. The lab recently demonstrated that administration of platelet activation inhibitors, aspirin and the ADPase, APT102, abrogated bone metastases in animal models suggesting a role for the use of platelet inhibitors to prevent metastases. In addition to finding that osteoclast inhibition can interfere with bone metastases, the lab found that increased osteoclast activity can promote tumor growth in bone. They also found that a commonly used adjunct to cancer chemotherapy, G-CSF, stimulated osteoclast activity and bone loss in mice and that G-CSF treated mice had increased tumor burden in bone. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of osteoclast activity abrogated the tumor growth enhancing effects of G-CSF. The lab also found that genetic disruption of hematopoeitic cell homing molecule, CXCR4, enhanced osteoclastogenesis and resulted in significant bone loss and suggest that CXCR4 is a negative regulator of osteoclast activity. Tumor growth specifically in bone was increased in mice reconstituted with CXCR4 null hematopoietic cells and this tumor growth enhancement phenotype was abrogated with the OC inhibitor, zoledronic acid. These data underscore the importance of evaluating the effects of cancer therapies on tumor microenvironment in bone, particularly in patients with bone metastases and provide ground-work for the development of targeted anti-metastasis therapies.

These viruses have genomes that are complementary to message sense RNA and must therefore carry into the cell the necessary machinery to copy their genomic RNA into mRNA. The genomes of the viruses can be non-segmented (ns) or segmented (s). We use vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model for the nsNS RNA viruses. The nsNS RNA viruses include some of the most significant human pathogens, as well as a number of highly lethal emerging infections.

"Williams, Philip"	"Developmental, Regenerative and Stem Cell Biology"	Neurosciences			"Research Interests: The primary long-term goal of our lab is to develop new strategies to improve patient outcomes following CNS injury and neurodegenerative disease. Our emphasis is towards treatments that both preserve and regenerate damaged neurons. We use the eye as a model system to study neuronal degeneration and regeneration because it provides many unique advantages including ease of accessibility and well documented neural circuit components.

Experimental Approaches: We primarily examine the sole projection neurons connecting the retina and the brain, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs send axons from the eye to the brain via the optic nerve, the only isolated white matter tract in the central nervous system. A major approach in the lab is to perform complete optic nerve injury, which severs all RGC axons and allows for unambiguous assessment of RGC axon regeneration. RGCs and their synaptic partners can be manipulated by viral delivery to overexpress or knockout most genetic targets. Additionally, we can similarly deliver pharmacological agents or growth factors to the eye to test efficacy of treatments that are more clinically relevant. A current focus of the lab is to examine how the synaptic and cellular milieu in the retina responds to remote RGC axon injury, and how such responses impact RGC survival and regeneration.

Another advantage of the eye is that retinal neurons can be monitored in vivo without surgical intervention. Our lab use multiphoton microscopy to monitor RGC responses to injury and disease. Although RGCs are all similar in that they convey visual information from the primary sensory organ of the retina to different brain regions, there are 40 or more identified RGC subtypes which all vary in characteristics like electrical activity, metabolic demands, and cellular stress capacity. Although a large proportion of RGCs die in conditions like optic nerve crush and glaucoma, RGC subtype differences have a major impact on likelihood of survival or cell death. A goal of our lab moving forward is to leverage the inherent differences in RGC responses to injury and disease conditions, like glaucoma, to generate new strategies of cellular preservation. Our main approach to doing this is observational science. We use in vivo imaging to determine what metabolic and signaling pathways might be disparate between well surviving and dying RGC subtypes. Such data can then be used to devise logical treatment targets that manipulate identified pathways.

In addition, emerging evidence has highlighted the important role of epigenetic mechanisms in the control of transcription. My laboratory focuses on identifying novel epigenetic pathways that cause changes in histone modifications and aberrant gene expression in HD, using cell and animal models of the disease. The underlying hypothesis is that deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms contributes to neuronal death and dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

"You, Zhongsheng"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Cancer Biology	Molecular Cell Biology		"The surveillance systems that safeguard the genome and the transcriptome ensure faithful transmission and expression of genetic information and determine the function and the fate of the cell. Defects in these systems are associated with cancer, aging and neurological disorders. Our laboratory is interested in understanding the molecular basis of the DNA and RNA surveillance systems and their relation to human diseases, especially cancer. Our work in DNA surveillance is focused on the cellular response to the most dangerous type of DNA damage, DNA double-strand breaks. This highly sophisticated DNA damage response suppresses cancer formation and is also an important target of cancer therapy. Our work has contributed to the understanding of a number of key biochemical processes such as ATM activation and DNA end resection in the DNA damage response. Currently, we are pursuing the following fundamental questions: 1. How do cells read the DNA damage signal and translate the signal into downstream checkpoint and repair responses? 2. How do cells maintain genome stability during DNA replication and gene expression?    In the RNA surveillance area, we focus on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD selectively eliminates aberrant transcripts harboring premature translation termination codons and also regulates the levels of many physiological mRNAs. NMD is an attractive target of therapeutic intervention for cancer and other genetic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Through a high-throughput drug screen using a novel reporter system, we have recently identified a group of cardiac glycosides such as ouabain and digoxin as potent inhibitors of NMD. Furthermore, we have discovered that intracellular calcium is a key regulator of NMD. Our current work is aimed at elucidating the mechanism and physiological significance of the calcium regulation of NMD. In addition, we are pursuing the potential connections between RNA surveillance and DNA surveillance pathways. We employ a powerful combination of experimental systems and tools, including human cell culture, Xenopus egg extracts, laser microirradiation, genetically encoded reporters and live cell imaging, to dissect the DNA and RNA surveillance systemsÑwith the long-term goal of improving the treatment of cancer and other diseases.

Metabolite Dynamics and Heterogeneity:ÊNature uses a suite of delicate regulatory systems to control both gene expression and pathway flux in response to environmental signals. When engineering microbial cells to produce fuels, chemicals, and materials, it is important to rewire the natural regulatory network, which was evolved for cell growth and replication, but not to over-produce any target compound. We are interested in developing tools to dissect the complex regulatory network of natural systems and to design synthetic regulatory systems that allow cell to control engineered pathways dynamically (Fig left). In addition, non-genetic, cell-to-cell variations in protein and metabolite concentrations cause large heterogeneity in single cell biosynthetic performance and dramatically affect ensemble product yields and titers (Fig right). We are interested in understanding the origin of metabolic noise and developing tools to regulate metabolic variation.
Advanced Biomaterials:Most synthetic polymers are currently derived from petroleum. Increasing concerns over petroleumÕs environmental impacts and declining supply demand the development of state-of-the-art technologies to manufacture polymers from renewable feedstocks. On the other hand, nature has evolved various types of materials with delicate nano-scale structural that endow desirable material properties at the macro-scale. We are interested in developing synthetic biology platforms to largely expand the synthetic power, producing high-performance materials with properties beyond their natural counterparts or with novel functions, enabling applications (sensing, protection, scaffolding, catalysis, etc.) not possible with existing materials.

"Zhao, Guoyan"	Biomedical Informatics and Data Science	Computational and Systems Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics		"AlzheimerÕs disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases and affect millions of people worldwide. Currently the molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis remains unclear and there are no therapies can prevent, slow, or halt disease progression. The focus of our lab is on dissecting the molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration through multiple integrated approaches including single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), network analysis, genomics, epigenomics and machine learning. Our long-term goal is to provide novel insights into the mechanism of disease pathogenesis and new targets for disease prevention and drug development. Areas of current interest include: 1) Dissect cellular and transcriptomic changes in AD and PD human brains using single nucleus RNA-seq; 2) Understand the relationship between neuroinflammation and selective neuronal death; 3) Computational tool development for single cell ligand-receptor signaling network analysis, transcriptional regulatory network analysis and their application on AD and PD snRNA-seq data. 4) Transcription regulation and AD and PD disease pathogenesis.

"Zhong, Xuehua"	Computational and Systems Biology	Molecular Genetics and Genomics	Plant and Microbial Biosciences		"Dr. Zhong is interested in how cellular machines sense intrinsic and extrinsic cues and alter chromatin landscapes to generate adaptive responses. Her group focuses on epigenetic regulation by exploring how chromatin dynamics is established, maintained, erased, and inherited over time, and how altered chromatin modifications lead to improved plant traits and environmental adaptation. They combine functional genomics and high-throughput proteomics and genomics techniques together with traditional genetic and biochemical tools to understand the function and mechanism of epigenetic processes and develop novel chromatin-based technology for biomass production and agricultural improvement.

"Zorumski, Charles"	"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"	Neurosciences			"Glutamate and GABA are the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the mammalian central nervous system, playing roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. On the one hand these agents function in normal synaptic transmission; yet alterations in these systems can have profound consequences leading to seizures and neuronal damage.Our laboratory is interested in the physiology and pharmacology of amino acid neurotransmitters with emphasis on the regulation of fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function. In our studies, we use whole cell voltage clamp and isolated patch recording techniques to examine modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA (kainate/AMPA) classes of glutamate receptors on postnatal rat hippocampal neurons and hippocampal slices. Other studies in the lab are examining factors contributing to short- and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the effects of neuroactive steroids and oxysterols on GABA and glutamate channels.
