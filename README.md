# DDBS Reviewer Recommendations

The DDBS Reviewer Recommendations desktop app helps pair students with appropriate faculty based on shared research interests. Use cases include picking admissions reviewers, qualifying exam committees, and rotations.

## Guided workflow inside the app
Once the app window is open, follow the on-screen form from top to bottom. Each section must be completed before you can continue.

1. **Select the student list** – Choose the source that contains the students needing reviewers. This may be a specific cohort, CSV upload, or another named list provided by your organization. The app highlights missing or incompatible choices so you can correct them before moving on.
2. **Pick eligible faculty** – Indicate which faculty members should be considered. You can include or exclude groups (for example, by department or specialty) and the app will display how many faculty remain in the pool.
3. **Set recommendation counts** – Decide how many reviewers each student should receive. Enter whole numbers only.
4. **Match** – The summary at the end shows every decision you made: the student list, selected faculty groups, and recommendation totals.
